# Chapter 2: Characters

## Creating a Character

You've taken the first step on your adventure, but you are still a 0th level human. Don't despair, because you become 1st level when you create your first character, and progress from there! To create a character, follow the nine steps below:

1. Start with a fresh character sheet. You can copy the one provided in this book, download and print one, or reproduce it by hand on a piece of paper. If all else fails, just scribble down notes on scratch paper!

2. Roll 3d6 in order for your character's ability scores, as described below under Character Abilities, and write the results after the names of the abilities. Write down the ability score bonus or penalty for each score, as shown on the Ability Score table.

3. Choose a class which suits your character's abilities from the Character Classes section. All classes have prime requisites, and some classes require minimum scores for some abilities. If abilities are not quite high enough for the class you would like to play, see Classes and Ability Scores for some options to adjust your scores. Write down the special abilities of your class, as described for each class.

4. Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) experience points (or XP); you may also want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class. Gaining experience points is explained in the Adventures and Campaigns chapters.

5. Roll hit points (hp) using the appropriate die for your class, adding your Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet. If your character has a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not lower any Hit Die roll below 1. (At your Judge's discretion, you may begin with the maximum hit points for 1st level.)

6. Record your character's attack throws and saving throws on your character sheet. Attack throws and saving throws are listed with each class, and described fully in the Adventures chapter. Note that attacks with melee weapons are modified by your Strength, while missile weapons such as bows or thrown daggers are modified by Dexterity. Don't forget to adjust your attack throws to reflect these modifiers.

7. Choose your character's starting proficiencies from the Proficiencies chapter. Apply any modifiers to your ability scores, hit points, attack throws, or saving throws from proficiencies. If you have chosen to play a mage or elven spellsword, roll for your starting spells, as described in the Spells chapter.

8. Generate your character's starting wealth by rolling 3d6x10 gold pieces (gp) and purchase equipment for your character from the lists in the Equipment chapter. Write your purchases on your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward. Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for your class before making your purchases. Since you now know what armor your character is wearing, note your Armor Class (AC) on the character sheet based on the type of armor you choose. Don't forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to AC. Likewise, record your weapon damages based on the type of weapons you choose, modified by your Strength bonus or penalty. Calculate your character's encumbrance based on how much weight he is carrying.

9. Give your character a name, and create a description of what your character looks like, his personality, and maybe even a brief note about the character's background. Then choose an appropriate Alignment for your character. Your Judge will have information on the setting of your character's world that can be helpful in naming your new character and developing his background.


### Generating Multiple Characters (Optional)

As an optional rule, at the start of play, each player generates five characters and select one primary and two back-up characters. The remaining two characters are given to the Judge to use as NPCs to populate the campaign setting. If the primary and back-ups are all killed, the player generates five additional characters, again picking three and giving the Judge two. This ensures that the player always has a variety of characters to choose from to find one he likes, and gives the Judge some additional NPCs to populate the world.


## Character Abilities

Character Abilities must be determined by rolling randomly. Roll 3d6 for each ability in the order listed below. As an optional rule, the Judge may allow you to roll 6 scores and then assign them to your abilities in any order you desire.

When complete, your character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has one or more prime requisite ability scores, which affect the rate at which the character will earn experience points. Some class may have other minimum ability requirements which must be met in addition.

###### Ability Score
|Ability Score|Bonus/Penalty|
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|3            |-3           |
|4-5          |-2           |
|6-8          |-1           |
|9-12         |0            |
|13-15        |+1           |
|16-17        |+2           |
|18           |+3           |

**Strength**: As the name implies, this ability measures the character's raw physical power. Strength is a prime requisite for assassins, explorers, dwarven vaultguards, elven spellswords, and fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to all attack throws and damage rolls in melee (hand-to-hand) combat. Note that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful attack below one point, unless the target is otherwise invulnerable to the attack (see the Adventures chapter for details).

**Intelligence**: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge. Intelligence is a prime requisite for elven nightblades, elven spellswords, and mages. The ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of proficiencies the character begins play with (see the Proficiencies chapter for details) and the number of languages the character is able to learn to read and write, as described below. Mages, elven nightblades, and elven spellswords increase the number of spells of each level in their repertoire by their Intelligence bonus (see the Spells chapter for details).

All characters begin the game knowing their native language. In most campaign worlds, the majority of humans speak a common language, often called "Common."  The demi-human races (elves and dwarves) have their own languages, and members of these  races normally begin play knowing their racial language, Common (or the local human language if it isn't called Common), and certain other languages based on the race.

A character with an Intelligence penalty will only know his native language, and cannot read more than a word or two. Characters with at least average Intelligence (9-12) will be literate in any languages they can speak. Characters with an Intelligence bonus may begin the game knowing one or more languages other than those given above; the number of additional languages that may be learned is equal to the Intelligence bonus (+1, +2, or +3). The player may also choose to leave one or more bonus language "slots" open, to be filled during play.

The languages available to characters include the demi-human languages (Elven, Dwarven, Gnomish, and Halfling) and the various beastmen dialects (e.g. Orc, Goblin). At the Judge's discretion, player characters may also begin play knowing ancient or archaic tongues, or exotic languages such as Draconic (the language of dragons). The specific languages available will depend on the campaign setting.

**Wisdom**: A combination of intuition, willpower and common sense. Wisdom is a prime requisite for bladedancers, clerics, and dwarven craftpriests. The Wisdom bonus or penalty applies to saving throws caused by spells or magic items. This would include, e.g., a save versus Blast against a fireball or a save versus Death from a finger of death, but not a save versus Petrification against a medusa's gaze.

**Dexterity**: This ability measures the character's quickness and balance as well as his aptitude with tools. Dexterity is a prime requisite for assassins, bards, bladedancers, elven nightblades, explorers, and thieves. A character's Dexterity bonus or penalty is applied to his attack throws with missile weapons, Armor Class value, and Initiative die rolls.

**Constitution**: Constitution is a combination of general health and vitality. Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each Hit Die rolled by the character. Note that a penalty here cannot reduce any Hit Die roll to less than 1 point.

**Charisma**: This is the ability to influence or even lead people; those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly respected. Charisma is a prime requisite for bards. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to the character's reaction rolls. Charisma also determines the maximum number of henchmen the character may employ, and modifies their morale. The number of henchmen a character may hire is equal to 4 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty (and therefore ranges from 1 to 7); the average morale of any such henchmen will be 0, modified by the character's Charisma bonus or penalty.

## Classes and Ability Scores

Once abilities have been determined, each player must choose a class. Each class has one or more prime requisite ability scores. A character must have an ability score of at least 9 in a class's prime requisite(s) in order to choose a particular class. Some classes have additional minimum ability score requirements. A character must have the minimum required ability, if one is indicated, in order to choose a particular class.

If a character's prime requisite ability is high enough, the character will receive a bonus to experience points earned during play. The Ability Prime Requisite table, below, details the effect a score in a prime requisite has on experience points earned by characters. If a class has two prime requisites, calculate the character's experience adjustment based on whichever prime requisite has the lower ability score.

###### Ability Prime Requisite
|Score|Experience Adjustment|
|:---:|:-------------------:|
|9-12 |0%                   |
|13-15|+5%                  |
|16-18|+10%                 |

Once a player has selected his character class, he may raise the class's prime requisite ability or abilities if desired by sacrificing points in other abilities. 2 ability points may be sacrificed from an ability to raise a prime requisite ability 1 point. This may be done more than once, but no ability can be lowered below 9, and no ability may be lowered if it is also a prime requisite for the class, even if there are a few points to spare above the minimum required score.


## Hit Points

Hit points are a measure of a character's ability to survive in combat. When a character, or any other being, is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he is incapacitated and possibly dead. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character's capacity to receive physical injury. Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant.

Each character class rolls a different kind of die to determine hit points, as noted in the Character Classes section, based on their toughness in battle. One die is rolled at first level, and further dice are rolled and cumulatively added to the total hp for each level of experience, unless otherwise noted. One optional rule, to allow first level characters to be hardier, is for the Judge to allow all hp rolls for first level characters to be considered the maximum result (e.g. an 8 for fighters or a 6 for clerics.)


## Character Classes

In the Adventurer Conqueror King System, there are two types of classes: human classes and demi-human classes. Humans are the most widespread of all races. Their ambition, cunning, and courage have led them to settle most of the known world, so most characters in the game will belong to one of the human classes.

The classes described in these rules are from the area surrounding Dunland, as such they are made up of mainly human classes such as the fighter, thief, bard, explorer, chosen, freebooter, loremaster, venturer and witch. Any of the player classes above can come from Dunland, Hendrica or Mycernia. It is however encouraged that human players characters come from Dunland to begin with.

Compared to humans, other races are rare, and generally more specialized. In the area dwarves from the citadel of Bul Thurim can be found and the bastard giantkin, remnants of the war two decades before. The dwarven classes described in these rules are the dwarven vaultguard, dwarven craftpriest, dwarven delvers and the dwarven machinist. The left behind remnants of the giantkin found in Dunland are represented by the giantkin bastard and giantkin misbegotten. It is anticipated that in the future more player available races and cultures will be revealed by travel and adventure.

Selecting equipment and proficiencies can be time-consuming, especially for new players. As a faster alternative, we offer a pre-generated template for each class, with weapons, armor, equipment, proficiencies, and spells ready for play. If you want to use these templates, you can skip step 8 (picking proficiencies and spells) and 9 (rolling for starting wealth and purchasing equipment) of character generation and simply use the template. A variety of additional templates, new classes, and rules for creating customized classes are available in the Adventurer Conqueror King System Player's Companion, available separately from Autarch.

## Fighter

| Prime Requisite:|STR     |
| :---------------|:-------|
| Requirements:   |None    |
| Hit Dice:       |1d8     |
| Maximum Level:  |14      |
| Age:            |14 + 1d8|

Fighters are exclusively trained in the arts of combat and war. They are specialists at dealing physical blows. Fighters may have learned their arts as warriors, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. Fighters are trained in the use of all weapons and armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, or wielding a weapon in each hand, as desired. At first level, fighters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (the best progression of any class). Fighters also increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

When a fighter reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his battlefield prowess inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter's Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Warlord), a fighter can, assuming enough gold is at hand, build a castle and become a great leader of men, taking a leadership rank in his society. When he does so, up 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 fighters of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Through force of arms, the fighter may ultimately control several castles or even entire realms, but must be a capable, strong leader and provide protection. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the Campaigns chapter.


| Template:           | Mercenary
| :------------------ | :--------
| Proficiencies:      | Combat Reflexes, Manual of Arms
| Starting Equipment: | Well-oiled sword, metal shield re-painted many times, slightly battered chainmail armor, crossbow, case with 20 quarrels,  military tunic, boots, backpack, 2 week's iron rations

This pre-generated template represents a wary sellsword. The template is ready for adventure. However, if your fighter's INT is 13 or greater, you may pick one or more additional general proficiencies before play if you'd like (see Starting Proficiencies in Chapter 4).

## Thief

| Prime Requisite: | DEX
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14
| Age:             | 15 + 1d8

Thieves have a range of unique skills associated with their profession that make them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves can be a bit shady and they sometimes are not as trustworthy as other classes. A thief will usually belong to a Thieves' Guild from the character's local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. At the Judge's discretion, a thief may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. Thieves are everywhere, from the slums to the highest halls of the government.

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first level, thieves hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. Because of their need for stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands.

A thief also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the thief will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A thief at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.

Thieves have the following range of skills, which improve as the thief gains levels according to the progression on the Thief Skills table. When a thief attempts to make use of one of his skills, the character or Judge will make a proficiency throw of 1d20. (Usually the Judge will make rolls for these abilities, because a thief is not always aware when he has failed.) After applying any relevant modifiers (e.g. due to the complexity of a lock), the result is compared to the target value listed on the Thief Skills table below for the appropriate skill. A result that is greater than or equal to the value listed for the proficiency throw that corresponds to the thief's level is a success. A roll of 20 is always a success, and a roll of 1 is always a failure.

**Opening Locks**: With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief may pick mechanical locks. He may only try to pick a particular lock once, and if he fails, he may not try the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the lock.

**Finding and Removing Traps**: Through careful inspection and probing, a thief may find hidden traps and then attempt to disable or discharge the trap harmlessly. A thief may only try to find or remove a trap once in any given area. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the trap. If the thief fails, he may not try again until he reaches a higher experience level. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he can remove it.

**Picking Pockets**: This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves for it is a quick source of income - though not without peril. A throw that is less than half the target value means that the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim's reaction.

**Moving Silently**: Thieves may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Thieves may move silently at  1/2  their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than  1/2  speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.

**Climbing Walls**: Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Thieves climb at  1/4  their standard combat movement rate.

**Hiding in Shadows**: A thief may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A thief will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.

**Hearing Noises**: Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway and at a door or other locations. The thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment.

Upon attaining 4th level, a thief gains the ability to read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a thief attains 9th level (Master Thief), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. A successful character might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the Campaigns chapter.

At 10th level, a thief can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

## Crusader

| Prime Requisite: | STR and INT
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14
| Age:             | 14 + 1d6

Crusaders are warrior priests of the Church of Nine, sworn to assist in the crusade against the Witchking of Shadowmire and preserve the lands of the faithful. Skilled combatants who use simplistic weapons and armour to fight, they can hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by 2 points every four levels of experience. Because crusaders lack the broad professional training of the fighter, they may only wear chain mail or lighter armor and are limited to fighting with clubs or staves, the simple  weapons that were taught on the crusade. Crusaders come from the lands of Dunland, Hendrica, Mycerna or Wefterna, they must be followers of the Nine lawful gods Alden, Bliss etc.

The first lesson taught to those Crusaders found worthy was the Laying on of Hands, this simple ceremony invokes a healing glow to help the wounded recover and has been the saviour of many after a battle. The person healed recovers hit points as if he had rested for one day per two levels of the healer (rounded up).

Starting at 2nd level (Lay worshipper) a Crusader begins to learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the Liturgical tradition. The crusader’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. The number and levels of ceremonies the crusader can include in his repertoire is shown on the Crusader Ceremony Progression table, but is increased by his Intelligence bonus. Crusaders can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the Heroic Magic chapter.

The repertoire of most crusaders for the first few spells was quite rigid. Cure Light Wounds, Salving Rest, Remove Fear, Purify Food and Water.

At 3rd level (Warder), a crusader gains the ability to inspire courage those accompanying him. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the crusaders’s allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster) and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A crusader can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring sermon gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A crusader cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

At 5th level (Catechist) due to the long time spent on crusade, resilience of the faithful is granted to the crusader. When a crusader is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Crusaders also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover. When a crusader reaches 5th level he may also begin to research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. Crusaders may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research

Upon attaining 9th level (Crusader), a crusader may establish or build a fortified church. So long as the crusader is currently in favor with his god, he may buy or build his fortified church at half the normal price due to divine intervention. Once a fortified church is established, the crusader’s reputation will spread and he will attract 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 crusaders of 1st-3rd level of the same religion to serve the order. They are completely loyal (morale +4). While in the crusaders’s service, his followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. The Judge determines which proportions of followers are archers, infantry, etc. Additional rules for fortified churches are detailed in the Campaign chapter.

At 11th level (Lord Crusader), a crusader may, learn and cast ritual spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. In addition, they enjoy divine health that renders them immune to all forms of disease, including magical diseases caused by spells, mummies, or lycanthropes.

##### Crusaders divine code
 
* _Comport oneself whilst at war in foreign land as one would at home_, Crusaders cannot pillage and must pay peasants for supplies they requisition.

* _Must clearly display the symbol of the Nine at all times_, Crusaders must let it be known that they walk in the light of the Nine.

* _Ban on indulgences_, Crusaders are forbidden from eating any food that was not available to the original Crusaders. Porridge, bread, eggs, turnips, roots, nuts, and any meat they personally hunt/catch are the typical fare of Crusaders

* _Requirements of daily prayer_,  Crusaders must lead a daily group prayer of the faithful against the enemies of the Nine

* _An Honourable passing_, Crusaders must cremate or give the correct burial rights for the deceased if time allows.

## Bard

| Prime Requisite: | DEX and CHA
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None

| Age:             | 14 + 1d8

Successful adventurers live forever in the sagas and songs about their deeds. Remembering and recounting these sagas is the profession of bards. Most bards are content to recite the deeds of others, but some bold few participate in the dangers themselves and become inspiring heroes in their own right. A bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald, or haughty aristocrat.

Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws as a thief, by two points every four levels of experience. At first level, bards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wield a weapon in each hand if desired. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields.

All bards can sing, recite poetry, or play a group of instruments in a skilled manner. The bard chooses the type of performance that his character knows. A bard may take the Perform proficiency to learn other types of performances (see Chapter 4, Proficiencies).

By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires  a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the bard's allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring epic gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

Because of their study of ancient annals and legends, bards possess loremastery. This knowledge allows them to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a bard must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in these tasks. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level.

This same knowledge allows bards to dabble in the arcane. They may attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic Items only useable by mages. At 1st level, the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge's discretion). The proficiency throw required reduces by 2 per level, to a minimum of 3+.

Upon attaining 4th level (Annalist), the bard gains the ability to read languages, including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings. A proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20 is required. If the roll does not succeed, the bard may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a bard reaches 5th level (Chronicler), his chronicles of battle inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the bard is there to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard's Charisma or proficiencies.

Upon reaching 9th level (Bard), a bard can build a hall and become a ruler. When he does so, up 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 bards of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Additional rules for halls are detailed in the Campaigns chapter.

At 10th level, the bard can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

| Prime Requisite: | Lowest ability score

| Requirements:    | Any ability score 18

Some men and women, whether out of desire for wealth, or fame, or power, or mere wanderlust, choose to be adventurers. But others are **chosen**, their paths guided by great powers toward heroic roads that lead them to everlasting glory—or ignominious death. A chosen can appear anywhere and at any time. The humblest farm boy is as likely to be marked by fate as the scion of a king. Chosen are, however, quite rare; fewer than 1 in 1,000 adventurers are chosen, and most people will live their entire lives without ever seeing one. When they do appear, they inevitably draw the attention of the great powers of light and darkness, ever ready to anoint a new champion or pre-emptively slay a new foe before he can come into the fullness of his power.

To qualify as a chosen, a character must have at least one natural ability score of 18. The chosen’s prime requisite is his lowest ability score. Since a character must have an ability score of at least 9 in a class’s prime requisite(s) in order to choose a particular class, a character must have at least 9 in every ability score or he cannot become a chosen. A chosen must always be of Lawful alignment. A chosen who changes to Neutral or Chaotic alignment loses all his gifts.

_\*Hit point modifiers from Constitution are ignored_

Chosen are blessed with an instinctive natural aptitude for combat. At first level, chosen hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Whether from preternatural skill or uncanny link, chosen increase their base damage roll from successful melee and missile attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. A chosen can fight with a two-handed weapon, a weapon in each hand, or a weapon and shield, as desired.

Despite their talents, most chosen begin their adventuring careers with limited knowledge of arms and armor. Chosen may only wear hide or lighter armor, and may only fight with bolas, clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, nets, slings, saps, and staffs. However, a chosen may use one or more gifts (see below) to train in the use of better armor or weapons, either at 1st level or later.

Every chosen receives **gifts** from the powers that have chosen him. Some gifts reveal themselves in overtly magical displays; other gifts may manifest as merely an instinctive aptitude for learning of particular skills, enabling the chosen to master in mere months what takes others a lifetime to learn.

At 1st level (Innocent), a chosen begins with three gifts. With each level of experienced gained thereafter, the number of gifts bestowed upon by the chosen increases, as shown on the Chosen Level Progression table.

Just as each chosen has a different destiny, so each has a different set of gifts. Chosen select their gifts from the list below. All selections must be approved by the Judge. Some gifts may be banned from particular settings where they are inappropriate or where they refer to optional rules that the Judge has opted not to use. Chosen can only select the same gift multiple times at the same level with the Judge’s approval.

### Chosen Gifts

*Armor Training:* The chosen trains to fight in armor. This gift may be selected multiple times. If selected once, the chosen can wear leather armor. If selected twice, the chosen can wear chain mail armor. If selected thrice, the chosen can wear plate armor.

*Aura of Protection:* The chosen gains a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The chosen’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with **detect good**, **detect magic**, or **true seeing**.

*Boon Companion:* Whenever an ally within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to allow the ally to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the ally can never re-roll a natural 1.

*Ceremonial Magic:* The chosen has learned the ceremonies of a particular tradition of ceremonial magic (antiquarian, liturgical, runic, sylvan, shamanic, or theurgical). The chosen must choose the tradition at the time he chooses the gift. When this gift is selected, the chosen becomes a 1st level ceremonialist with a repertoire of one 1st level ceremony. He can perform ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a 1st level ceremonialist, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each subsequent time it is selected, the chosen can either reduce the proficiency throw required to identify trinkets and talismans of a tradition he already knows by 4; learn another tradition; add one ceremony (of any level he can perform) to his repertoire; or increase his ceremonialist caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of ceremonies.

*Charismatic Ferocity:* When attacking with one-handed melee weapons or thrown weapons, the chosen may apply his CHA modifier instead of his STR modifier on his damage rolls.

*Chosen Weapon:* The chosen can designate a particular individual weapon as his chosen weapon. The chosen weapon must be given a name (e.g. “Excalibur” or “Anduril”). When the chosen wields his chosen weapon, it is treated as if its magical bonus to attack and damage were 1 point greater. This gift may be selected multiple times, but no more than once at 1st to 4th level, twice at 5th to 9th level, and thrice at 10th level and above. Each time it is selected the chosen can increase the bonus of his chosen weapon or designate an additional weapon as a chosen weapon.

*Cleansing Touch:* By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly remove a curse or dispel a harmful magical effect. The chosen must be of equal or greater level than the spellcaster who cast the curse or effect.

*Courage:* The chosen has mastered his fear and will never shirk from his destiny. He is immune to normal and magical fear effects.

*Destined:* The chosen gains two Fate Points. This gift may be selected multiple times.

*Determined:* The chosen may spend a Fate Point after making an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw to set the result of the throw to 10 (instead of re-rolling). The chosen cannot spend a Fate Point in this manner if the original roll was a natural 1, however.

*Divine Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, and Sensing Evil. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.

*Eldritch Talent:* The chosen manifests the ability to cast an eldritch spell at certain intervals. The spell selected may be of any level, up to the chosen’s level of experience. The spell is cast as if the chosen were of the minimum caster level for the spell. The frequency with which the chosen can cast is determined by the spells’ level. 1st – once per hour; 2nd – once per 8 hours; 3rd – once per day; 4th – once per week; 5th – once per month; 6th – once per year. The chosen does not have a spellbook and cannot change his repertoire. This gift does not allow the chosen to use scrolls or magic items usable only by mages or clerics. This proficiency can be selected multiple times to gain the ability to cast additional spells.

*Eldritch Warrior:* When the chosen successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend a spell to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell expended. The chosen must have gained spellcasting abilities from the Eldritch Talent gift before selecting this gift.

*Farseeing:* The chosen can see the fates of mortals. He may determine how many Fate Points a character has after 10 minutes (1 turn) of casual interaction or observation. Once per week, the chosen may cast **fate** (as the spell) with a casting time of 10 minutes (1 turn).

*Friends of Birds and Beasts*: The chosen can understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character). This gives the chosen a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals, and allows him to take animals as henchmen. The chosen can also identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+.

*Gift of Tongues:* The chosen has a gift for learning new tongues. Each time this gift is selected, he may learn four additional languages.

*Hard to Kill:* When a chosen is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. The chosen also subtract his class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.

*Healing Touch:* By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly heal the creature by an amount equal to his Base Healing Rate or the creature’s Base Healing Rate, whichever is less.

*Inspiring:* By reciting heroic lays or stirring words for a few moments before a battle (one round), a chosen can grant his allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the character), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A chosen can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. A chosen cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

*Invulnerable:* The chosen is blessed with partial invulnerability to harm. Any damage the chosen suffers from non-magical attacks is reduced by 1 point per die. The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity. This gift can be selected up to three times. Each additional time the gift is selected, damage suffered is reduced by 1 additional point per die, to a maximum of 3 points per die.

*Lion-Hearted:* If the chosen is serving as a commander or hero on the battlefield with an army, the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. This benefit is lost for the duration of the battle, however, if the chosen himself routs, flees, or leads from the rear (see Domains at War: Battles, p. XX).

*Lucky:* When re-rolling attack throws, proficiency throws, or saving throws using Fate Points, the chosen may roll the die twice and choose the better value.

*Keen Eyes:* The chosen can detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection.

*Magical Music*: The chosen gains the ability to sing spells. He gets two spell points and has one 1st level eldritch spell in his repertoire, which he casts as a 1st level spellsinger. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each time the gif its selected, the character can either increase his caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level; or gain two spell points and add one additional eldritch spell (of any level he can spellsing) to his repertoire. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of spellsinging spells.

*Magical Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Battle Magic, Collegiate Wizardry, Elementalism, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, or Unflappable Casting. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.

*Martial Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alertness, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery, Fighting Style, Precise Shooting, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections.

*Martial Talent:* The chosen has a native aptitude for weapons. The chosen gains a +1 bonus to attack throws with his choice of either melee or missile attacks. This gift can be selected twice, once for melee and once for missile attacks.

*Martial Training:* The chosen has had training in use of arms. This gift may be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected, choose one of the following types of weapons and add these to the list of weapons permitted to the character: (1) axes; (2) bows/crossbows; (3) flails/hammers/maces; (4) swords/daggers; (5) spears/pole arms; (6) any four weapons.

*Meditative Focus:* The chosen can go into a state of intense Zen-like focus once per day per level of experience. While in focus, the character gains a +1 bonus to all attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls. A meditative focus lasts for 1 turn (10 minutes).

*Military Genius:* The chosen commands the battlefield like a god of war. He gains a permanent +1 bonus to his strategic ability, leadership ability, and morale modifier when commanding troops on the battlefield.

*Mystical Bloodline*: The chosen is the scion of an otherworldly or inhuman power. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s lifespan is extend to three times longer than normal, and he ceases to show further signs of aging. He also gains the elf’s immunity to paralysis. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s ancestry manifests somehow in his appearance (pointed ears, golden eyes, a strange birthmark, or other unusual trait.)

*Scion of Kings:* The blood of ancient lords flows in the chosen’s veins. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.

*Second Sight:* The chosen has a connection to the hidden world, and can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the chosen can see them, and may often take a particular interest in him as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see characters hiding in shadows, secret doors, traps, or other creatures or objects hidden through cover and concealment, but does provide a +4 bonus to saving throws to disbelieve illusions.

*Student of War:* The chosen can select one proficiency, choosing Command, Military Strategy, Leadership, or Siege Engineering. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency or proficiency rank each time.

*Sworn Foe:* When this gift is selected, the chosen must designate one specific individual monster or NPC by its name or unique physical characteristic (e.g. “the six-fingered man”). That creature becomes his sworn foe. The chosen gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and saving throws when confronting his sworn foe. If the chosen lands a successful attack on his sworn foe (including spells), the chosen can spend a Fate Point to deal double damage with the attack. If the sworn foe lands a successful attack on the chosen, the chosen can spend a Fate Point to halve the damage dealt by the attack. Once a chosen defeats his sworn foe, he may name a new sworn foe at any time thereafter. A sworn foe must have at least equal HD or levels of experience than the chosen; if the chosen ever surpasses his sworn foe in level or HD, he must select a new foe.

*Thievery Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Acrobatics, Alertness, Ambushing, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Contortionism, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Passing Without Trace, Running, Skulking, and Trap Finding. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections.

*Thievery Training:* The chosen can select one thief skill, choosing from Find Traps, Hide in Shadows, Move Silently, Open Locks, Pick Pockets, and Remove Traps. Thereafter the chosen can perform this skill as a thief of his level. This proficiency may be selected multiple times to gain additional thief skills, to a maximum limit of three selections.

*Tribulating Adversary:* Whenever an enemy within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to force the enemy to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the chosen can never force a re-roll of a natural 20.

*Wholeness of Body:* The chosen is immune to all forms of poison, including magical poisons.

When a chosen reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his **sense of destiny** inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the chosen gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the chosen’s Charisma, proficiencies, or class powers.

At 9th level (Chosen), a chosen can **establish a stronghold** and become a protector of men. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries.

## Explorer

| Prime Requisite: | STR and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None

| Maximum Level:   | 14
| Age:             | 15 + 1d8

Explorers are scouts and trackers, adept at both woodcraft and archery. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. An explorer might be a long range scout, a hunter from the northern forests, or a settler pushing past the borders civilization.

While they prefer to evade foes where possible, explorers are cunning warriors when they need to be. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. At first level, explorers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. In addition, they gain an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Explorers are trained to fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wear chain mail or lighter armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Explorers have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Outdoors, explorers are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, an explorer who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.

Parties guided by explorers gain significant advantages on wilderness adventures. Any time the explorer's party is in country familiar to the explorer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the explorer's party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters.

A party guided by an explorer can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+. See the Wilderness Adventures and Evasion and Pursuit sections of Chapter 6 for more details on getting lost and evading encounters.

When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassures those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer's Charisma or proficiencies.

When an explorer reaches 9th level (Warden), he may decide to build a border fort in the borderlands or wilderness. When he does so, up to 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 explorers of 1st - 3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. The character becomes the warden of any nearby settlers, and will attract more settlers over time. These people will look to the Warden as their leader, responsible for the growth and safety of their settlement. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the Campaigns chapter.

## Freebooter

| Prime Requisite: | DEX (plus one ability score determined by path)
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14
| Age:             | 14 + 1d8

Freebooters are a motley assortment of adventurers who live and die for plunder.
Some freebooters are dauntless expeditionaries who raid tombs for ancient
treasures. Others may be brutal ruffians who rob and ravage the weak and
foolish, cunning scoundrels with the charisma to convince their marks to hand
over their wealth willingly, or hardy wayfarers who exact a toll on any who
cross the roads and trails of their wilderness homes. Whatever their particular
path to plunder, wayfarers share a lust for adventure, a taste for gold, and a
willingness to resort to subterfuge and backhanded tactics without hesitation.

Like thieves, freebooters often belong to a **criminal guild** which offers
shelter and information between heists. At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter
may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for
protection. In the Dunland, freebooters are everywhere, from the slums of
the ports in Nortwyke to the highest halls of the court in Gleynafon.

Freebooters are ruthless, dirty combatants. At first level, freebooters hit an
unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in
attack throws by two points every *three* levels of experience. However they
advance in saving throws like thieves, by two points every *four* levels of
experience.

_\*Hit point modifiers from constitution are ignored_

All freebooters may wear leather armor or lighter, and may wield crossbows,
daggers, shortbows, short swords, and swords, as well as five other weapons
determined by their path (see below). They may fight wielding a weapon
two-handed and wielding a weapon in each hand, but may not use shields. They may only use magic items usable by thieves.

Lacking the staying power of fighters, freebooters prefer to strike from ambush
and finish their foes quickly. A freebooter whose opponent is unaware of his
presence can **backstab** him. When backstabbing, the freebooter receives an
attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deals additional damage for every four
levels he has attained. A freebooter at 1st through 4th levels does double the
normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th
levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does
quintuple the normal damage.

Freebooters **increase their damage** from their choice of either missile *or*
melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and
12th level. The freebooter must choose which type of attack will receive the
damage bonus at 1st level, and may not change the choice as he advances (i.e.
they may choose to be either melee or missile specialists).

A freebooter’s plundering pursuits are shaped by his **path to wealth**. There
are four paths to wealth available to a freebooter: Expeditionary, Ruffian,
Scoundrel, and Wayfarer. Each path offers a different set of abilities
reflecting that path’s preferred methods to accumulate wealth. When a freebooter
is created, select a path for the character from the Paths to Wealth table
below, and write down the proficiencies and powers of the path. Each path
teaches the use of a selection of five additional weapons, trains the character
in four thief skills, and grants five bonus proficiencies. Note that each path
has its own prime requisite in addition to DEX.

|Path         | Description
|:------------|:---
|Expeditionary| A looter of tombs and a delver of dungeons, skilled in scouting, trap-finding, and lock-picking.
|Ruffian      | A cut-throat and killer, skilled in breaking and entering, robbery, and intimidation.
|Scoundrel    | A noble thief, skilled in subterfuge and disguise.
|Wayfarer     | An outrider, or scout, skilled in hunting, trapping, and survival.

At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter may follow a unique path, outside of the
four listed above. The player and Judge should collaborate to choose five
weapons, four thief skills, and five bonus proficiencies that are appropriate to
the freebooter.

### Path of Expeditionary

| Prime Requisite:     | WIS
| :------------------- | :-----
| Weapons:             | hand axe, pole arm, spear, staff, war hammer
| Thief Skills:        | find traps, open locks, move silently, remove traps
| Bonus Proficiencies: | Alertness, Climbing, Dungeon Bashing, Mapping, Trap Finding

The expeditionary is a looter of tombs and a delver of dungeons. He often serves
as point-man on dungeon delves due to his ability to find both secret doors and
traps more effectively than almost any other adventurer. His ability to climb
walls and move silently allows him to scout ahead undetected by listening
guards, while his training in disarming traps, opening locks, and bashing doors
enables him to penetrate almost any obstacle in his path to plunder.
Expeditionaries are also excellent map-makers and most treasure maps are created
by them.

### Path of Ruffian

| Prime Requisite:     | STR
| :------------------- | :-----
| Weapons:             | battle axe, club, morning star, sap, whip
| Thief Skills:        | hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets
| Bonus Proficiencies: | Dungeon Bashing, Fighting Style (ruffian’s choice), Intimidation, Skulking, Swashbuckling

The ruffian is a cut-throat and killer. A ruffian can cut the purses of
passersby, skulk in the shadows to waylay unsuspecting victims, break into homes
and burglarize their valuables, or simply rely on his threatening demeanor and
martial prowess to rob victims at sword-point. Most freebooters are ruffians,
and they can be found in great numbers in any den of scum and villainy.

### Path of Scoundrel

| Prime Requisite:     | CHA
| :------------------- | :-----
| Weapons:             | arbalest, dart, mace, sap, whip
| Thief Skills:        | hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets
| Bonus Proficiencies: | Cat Burglary, Climbing, Disguise, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading

The scoundrel is a noble thief. His ability to scale walls, open locks, hide
in shadows, and move silently enables him to function as nigh-undetectable cat
burglar, stealing his victims’ most precious treasures without need for
violence. An expert in disguise, he can blend in to any crowd, where his
graceful sleight-of-hand can relieve his marks of their important papers and
burdensome purses. Skilled eavesdroppers and lip readers, scoundrels often work
as spies and secret agents, uncovering secrets that the powerful wish to keep
hidden.

### Path of Wayfarer

| Prime Requisite: | CON
| :--------------- | :----
| Weapons:    |  bola, hand axe, longbow, net, staff
| Thief Skills:        | climb walls, hear noise, hide in shadows, move silently
| Bonus Proficiencies:   | Land Surveying, Running, Sniping, Skirmishing, Tracking

The wayfarer is an outrider, and scout. He excels at hit-and-run attacks, sniping from the cover of darkness and brush, then falling back swiftly and silently into the wilderness. He has the ability to move through the wilderness at great speed, and can navigate mountainous terrain, climb trees, and scale precipices that halt pursuers. If inclined to law, wayfarers may use their expertise in tracking and land surveying to discover monster lairs in the wilderness for adventuring parties or local garrisons.

While each path of freebooter knows different thief skills, all follow the same
progression of improvement, as shown on the Freebooter (Thief) Skill Progression
table, below.

###### Freebooter (Thief) Skills

 _\* -1 penalty on the proficiency throw per each level the freebooter is lower than the victim._

When a freebooter attains 9th level (Freebooter Captain), he can establish a
**hideout**, and 2d6 freebooter apprentices of 1st level will come to work with
the character. The freebooters will be of the same path as their captain. If
hired, they must be paid standard rates. Additional rules for hideouts are
detailed in the **Campaign** chapter.

## Loremaster

| Prime Requisite: | INT and WIS
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14
| Age:             | 17 + 3d6

Loremasters pursue knowledge and preserve ancient wisdom handed down from time immemorial. Most loremasters live ascetic lives devoted to annotating and studying the books and scrolls collected by their predecessors. But the boldest and most ambitious become adventurers, delving into the dungeons and tombs of past kingdoms in search of knowledge which has been lost. Wielding secrets forgotten for centuries, these loremasters become the most powerful of their kind, legends whose deeds will become the subject of study by the annalists of the future.

Because of their devotion to study, loremasters receive limited combat training. At first level, loremasters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every *six* levels of experience (i.e. half as fast as fighters), though they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, and darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. For these reasons, loremasters are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

The books and scrolls of interest to the loremaster are virtually never written in the Common tongue so loremasters soon become familiar with even the most obscure scripts, codes, and languages. At 1st level, a loremaster may **read languages** unfamiliar to them (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the loremaster may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience. 

From careful study of ancient annals and legends, loremasters can decipher occult mysteries, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a loremaster must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in **loremastery**. The proficiency throw for loremastery reduces by 1 per level.

Most importantly, the scholarly pursuits of loremasters allow them to **learn and perform eldritch ceremonies** in the **theurgical tradition**. A loremaster’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his **repertoire**. A loremaster’s repertoire can include a number of eldritch ceremonies up to the number and level of ceremonies listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. A loremaster can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics, and can make trinkets to aid his performance of ceremonies. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the Heroic Magic chapter (p. XX).

As they advance in level, loremasters may add new ceremonies to their repertoire by visiting an athenaeum or other place of learning (see below) and spending one game week per ceremony. Particular athenaeums may only offer particular ceremonies at each level, either due to the limitations of their libraries or doctrinal beliefs. Loremasters who wish to learn unavailable ceremonies must find or research them on their own. The specific ceremonies taught at any given athenaeum should be determined by the Judge based on his setting.

As part of his training in ceremonial magic, every loremaster creates a **personal talisman** to aid him in performing ceremonies. The loremaster’s personal talisman provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. (The loremaster may choose from death & necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment & illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification). When the loremaster advances to 3rd level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase the bonus to +2 for the current type or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). When the loremaster reaches 11th level, his personal talisman can increase its bonus by another +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase a +2 bonus to +3 for a current type, or increase a +1 bonus to +2 for a current type, or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). If desired, the loremaster may increase the bonus afforded by, or number of ceremony types covered by, his personal talisman by selecting the Personal Talisman proficiency (see p. XX). More information on talismans can be found in the Ceremonial Talismans section of the Heroic Magic chapter (p. XX).

*\*Hit point modifiers from constitution are ignored*


When a loremaster reaches 5th level (Scholar), he may begin to research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, brew potions, and make talismans. Loremasters may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research.

When a loremaster reaches 9th level (Loremaster), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A loremaster may also build an **athenaeum**, typically a great library, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal men seeking to become loremasters. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the loremaster’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the loremaster builds a **menagerie** beneath or near his athenaeum, monsters may be collected therein. Loremaster’s athenaeum and menageries are otherwise identical to mages’ sanctums and dungeons, as detailed in the **Campaign** chapter of the *ACKS* Rulebook.

At 11th level, a loremaster may create learn and cast ritual eldritch spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the loremaster may create necromantic servants and become undead.

| Requirements:    | None

Paladins are champions of Law who crusade unceasingly against those who seek to extinguish the light of civilization. Wherever the forces of Chaos marshal to threaten man, Paladins can be found, battling back the darkness with courage and steel. In and around Dunland, most Paladins are found in service to the Nine or one of the individual gods which make up the Nine. 

As holy warriors, Paladins are highly trained combatants. At first level, Paladins hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every *three* levels of experience. Knights increase their base damage roll from missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

They may wear any armor, and may fight with a broad array of weapons, namely the battle axe, flail, lance, mace, morning star, pole arm, spear, sword, two-handed sword, and war hammer. All paladins may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, or wielding a weapon in each hand, as desired. They may use any magic item usable by fighters. 

All paladins must be of Lawful alignment. A paladin who changes to Neutral or
Chaotic alignment loses his class powers.

If he later reverts to Lawful alignment and atones for any misdeeds (possibly through a **quest** or **atonement** spell) he can regain his lost powers. (A paladin who becomes Chaotic might be permitted to become an **anti-paladin**, at the Judge’s discretion. Such a black hearted traitor will be hated throughout
civilized lands, of course.)

In exchange for their devotion to Law, paladins receive many powers to aid them in their crusades against Chaos. Foremost among these is their **aura of protection**, which gives them a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The paladin’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with **detect good**, **detect magic**, or **true seeing**.

Paladins also possess **sanctified bodies** that are completely immune to the ravages of disease, including magical diseases. This enables them to go on long crusades without succumbing to the diseases that kill many soldiers, as well as to face dread foes such as mummies or werewolves without fear of corruption.

In order to defeat the enemies of Law, the paladin must find them. To this end, a paladin can **detect evil** (as the spell) up to 60’ away simply by concentrating. Each use takes a turn. (For purposes of the paladin’s aura and detection abilities, “evil” creatures include all undead, all summoned creatures, and any Chaotic creatures intending harm the paladin. Sinkholes of evil and magic items harmful to those of Lawful alignment will also be detected by the paladin’s power.)

Finally, paladins may **lay on hands**, on others or on their own person, in order to heal injuries. A paladin will heal 2 points of damage per level when the power is used. A paladin may use his power to lay on hands once per day. A paladin may select the Laying on Hands proficiency to gain additional uses of the power per day.

When a paladin reaches 5th level (Guardian), his **holy fervor** inspires others to follow him. Any hirelings of the same religion as the paladin gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he is present. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the paladin’s Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Paladin Lord), a paladin can found or capture a **fortress** and become a protector of men. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 paladins of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Paladins’ dark fortresses are otherwise identical to fighters’ castles, as detailed in the **Campaign** chapter of the *ACKS* Rulebook.

Commerce is the great wheel upon which the world turns. From the fleshy fingers
of slave traders to jewel-clad guild masters, the coin and commodities of the
empire are controlled by merchants. But if the stereotypical merchant is a
pot-bellied financier profiting from the work of others, the venturer is his
opposite: An adventurous world traveler, he personally leads caravans into
unknown lands, seeking out exotic goods and new markets. Every venturer is, by
definition, an adventurer, and interested in any expedition that promises riches
and reward.

Venturers are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first
level, venturers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They
advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every *four* levels of
experience (i.e. the same as thieves). They may use any missile weapons and any
one-handed melee weapons. They can fight with a shield or with a weapon in each
hand, but cannot fight two-handed. Venturers prefer to stay mobile and cannot
wear armor heavier than chainmail.

The business of venturers is business, and their devotion to trade and profit
yields them many special abilities. Foremost among these is the **mercantile
network** of contacts, fences, and peddlers that venturers build through their
travels. Whenever venturers buy and sell equipment, hire retainers, and engage
in mercantile ventures in a market they have previously visited, they treat the
market as if it were one market class larger than its actual size. (Class I
markets remain Class I markets.)

EXAMPLE: Cain, a 5th level venturer, is in Lingmell (a Class IV market). He
wishes to purchase a heavy warhorse (700gp). According to the Equipment
Availability by Market Class table, there is only a 25% chance for 1 heavy
warhorse to be available in a Class IV market. However, Cain has visited
Lingmell before, so he may treat it as a Class III market. There is a 100%
chance for 1 heavy warhorse available in a Class III market, so Cain is able to
purchase the heavy warhorse. His party members shake their heads in amazement
that he’s found such a fine steed in an outpost town. “I know people,” he
explains.

Venturers are **expert bargainers** who get the best deals available for goods,
services, and information. Any items the venturer purchases cost 10% less than
the listed price and any items he sells go for 10% more than the listed price
(as per the Bargaining proficiency). If trading with another venturer, or a
character with the Bargaining proficiency, the opposed bargainers should make
reaction rolls. Whichever character scores the higher result gets the discount.
A venturer may select Bargaining proficiency to improve his skills. Each time
the proficiency is selected, the character receives a +2 bonus on his reaction
roll when negotiating with other bargainers.

Venturers know that business empires can rise and fall on information, so they
learn to keep their ears open at all times. All venturers can **hear noises** as
thieves of their level.

They likewise become conversant in the tongues of their trading partners. Venturers begin play with four **bonus languages** selected from among those in common use in the campaign setting (Judge’s discretion). Venturers are also experts in **reading languages**, on a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20, the venturer can decipher a document (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings). If the roll does not succeed, the venturer may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

While most merchants consider risk a financial term, venturers lead their own caravans or fleets, and do so with considerable skill. As **expert travellers**, venturers begin play with Riding or Seafaring proficiency (their choice). Any time the venturer’s party is in terrain familiar to the venturer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to **avoid getting lost**.

In order to open new markets and establish trade with unknown tribes, venturers study **diplomacy**. They receive a +2 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures (as per the Diplomacy proficiency). Of course, not every market obeys the rule of law, so venturers also become exceptionally skilled at the art of **bribery**. Offering a bribe permits an additional reaction roll during encounters, with the throw modified by the size of the bribe. As a general rule, a bribe equal to one day’s pay for the target provides a +1 bonus, a week’s pay provides a +2 bonus, and a month’s pay provides a +3 bonus. Only one bribe can be attempted per target in any given situation. 

When a venturer attains 9th level (Merchant Prince), he can establish a **guildhouse**, and 2d6 venturer apprentices of 1st level will offer to work for him. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. Many venturers use these followers to start a syndicate, expanding their wealth through legitimate and illegitimate channels. Except as noted, a venturer’s guildhouse follows the rules for hideouts detailed in the **Hideouts & Hijinks** section of Chapter 7 of *ACKS.*

The ignorant will often refer to any female spellcaster as a witch. Actual witches, however, are practitioners of a distinct craft of magic. Like priestesses and shamans, witches invoke ceremonial eldritch magic, but they do not organize into communities of faith nor do they dedicate themselves to the service of their gods or goddesses. Rather, the relationship of a witch to her divine patron is that of student to teacher, rooted in ancient pacts and secretive traditions. The witch seeks to gain personal knowledge and strength by accepting the guidance and patronage of ancient powers. This quest for knowledge and power often drives witches to become adventurers.

Witches are viewed with deep suspicion by the most priests, but many rural villages nevertheless have a wise woman with some skill in witchcraft. Witches are fairly common in Dunland and the surrounding lands, each of which has flourishing traditions of witchcraft.

Witches receive little combat training. At first level, witches hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every *six* levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every *four* levels of experience (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with clubs, daggers, darts, or staffs. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. 

Starting at 1st level, a witch begins to **learn and perform eldritch ceremonies** in the ceremonial magic tradition which equates to their tradition of witchcraft. The witch’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in her **repertoire**. The number and levels of ceremonies the witch can include in her repertoire is shown on the Witch Ceremony Progression table, but is increased by her Intelligence bonus. Witches can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the Magic chapter (p. XX).

As part of her studies in eldritch ceremonial magic, every witch creates a **personal talisman** to aid her in performing ceremonies. The witch’s personal talisman provides a +1 bonus to ceremony throws for ceremonies of one particular type. When the witch advances to 3rd level, her personal talisman can increase its bonus by +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase the bonus to +2 for the current type). When the witch reaches 11th level, her personal talisman can increase its bonus by another +1 for ceremonies of one particular type (e.g. increase a +2 bonus to +3 for a current type, or increase a +1 bonus to +2 for a current type, or add a bonus of +1 with a new type). If desired, the witch may increase the bonus afforded by or number of ceremony types covered by her personal talisman by selecting the Personal Talisman proficiency (see p. XX). More information on talismans can be found in the Ceremonial Talismans section of the Heroic Magic chapter (p. XX). 

When a witch reaches 3rd level (Siren), she may begin to brew potions. When a witch reaches 5th level (Sibyl), she is able to research spells. Upon reaching 7th level (Sorceress), she may scribe magical scrolls. At 9th level (Witch), she is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a witch may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level) and craft magical constructs. Witches perform such magic research as clerics of their level.

Every witch must belong to a **tradition**, which defines her approach to the magic and her relationship with the gods and spirits that are her source of power. When a witch is created, select a tradition for the character from the Tradition table below, and write down the powers of the tradition. Each also provides a special ability at 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th level.

Different traditions are practiced in different countries, the table below shows all the potential choices available.

|Tradition  | Region                                              |Description

|Antiquarian| Dunland, Hendrica, Mycernia, ~~Wefterna~~, ~~Jerez~~| Wise women who focus on healing and beneficial potions, they practice their traditional craft wherever rural human settlements may be found.
|Chthonic   | ~~Shadowmire~~, ~~Far&#160;Isles~~,                 | Malefic practitioners who consort with the darkest of powers, reveling in the seduction and corruption of the innocent.                     
|Sylvan     | ~~Acernai&#160;Tribes~~, ~~Viccada~~                | Reclusive witches who travel the borderlands between human settlements and fey forests.

3rd level: The witch has learned **grey lore**, straddling darkness and light. She gains the ability to turn undead as a cleric of one half her class level. When the witch casts spells that inflict fear effects (such as **cause fear**), the spell effects are calculated as if she were two class levels higher than her actual level of experience, and are resisted with a -2 penalty on the saving throw.

5th level: Through ecstatic dancing, wild drumming, chanting, and intoxicating smoke, the voudon witch can regain her strength. She may **perform spiritual rituals** as a shaman. 

7th level: The voudon witch’s evil eye can bewitch and deceive. She gains **mastery of charms and illusions**, identical to that of an elven enchanter. 

Upon attaining 9th level (Witch), a witch of any tradition may establish a **coven**, usually in a remote and desolate location. If she does so, he will attract 1d6 apprentices of her tradition between 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal women seeking to become witches. Their Wisdom scores will be above average, but many will become fearful of the sacrifices involved and quit after 1d6 months. While in the witch’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the witch builds a **dungeon** beneath or near her coven, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them. Witches’ covens are otherwise identical to mages’ sanctums, as detailed in the **Campaign** chapter of the *ACKS* Rulebook.

## Dwarven Vaultguard

Dwarves are stout, short, bearded demi-humans who average a height of approximately 4' and weigh about 150lb. Perhaps not surprisingly, they have skin, hair and eye colors in earth tones. Dwarves have a reputation for having surly attitudes, and are particularly gruff with elves. They value precious metals and stones, and live in deep underground vaults, where they endure constant raids from the orcs, trolls, and even worse denizens of the darkness below.

Dwarves trained to defend their race's underground vault from the endless hordes that threaten it are called vaultguards. Though most vaultguards are born, live and die in the vault, from time to time a young vaultguard will be dispatched to foreign realms on a warrior's pilgrimage. The few vaultguards who return from such pilgrimages bring gold and glory to their clans, often leading them to found new vaults and become great lords. The dwarven vaultguard class represents such a dwarf.

Dwarven vaultguards are highly trained combatants. At first level, dwarven vaultguards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Due to their short height, dwarven vaultguards cannot use human-sized two-handed weapons (such as two-handed swords or pole arms) or longbows, but they can use any other weapon or armor. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function.

In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Vaultguard Attack and Saving Throws table below. Dwarven characters speak the Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction with other races they can also speak Frost Giant, Dunish, Hendrical, and the Dark tounge of the Beastmen.

When a dwarven vaultguard reaches 9th level (Vaultlord), he can attract dwarves from far and wide by constructing his own underground vault. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character's clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A dwarven vaultguard is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the Campaigns chapter.

| Requirements:    | CON 9

Nothing is so revered among the dwarven people as craftsmanship. A dwarf's work is his life, and the spirits of great dwarven artisans are believed to live on forever in their masterpieces. The veneration of these relics falls to the care of a caste of dwarves known as craftpriests. While most craftpriests attend to the shrines and monuments of their clan, young craftpriests are sometimes sent forth to recover monuments to the glorious past from the ancient ruins and wastelands of the world. This class represents such a craftpriest.

At first level, dwarven craftpriests hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Dwarven craftpriests advance in attack throws and saving throws as clerics, by two points every four levels of experience. Dwarven craftpriests may wear any armor and may use any of the traditional weapons of their people, including the battle axe, great axe, hand axe, flail, mace, morning star, and warhammer. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield or wielding a weapon two-handed, but may not dual wield weapons.

Starting at 2nd level (Craft-Acolyte), a craftpriests begins to **learn and perform eldritch ceremonies** in the **runic tradition**. The craftpriest’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his **repertoire**. The number and levels of ceremonies the craftpriest can include in his repertoire is shown on the Craftpriest Ceremony Progression table, but is increased by his Intelligence bonus. Craftpriests can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the Magic chapter (p. XX).

Because of their **religious training**, a craftpriest can automatically identify religious symbols, trappings, and holy days of the dwarven faith, and recognizes those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. In addition, each dwarven craftpriest is a **master in a particular type of craft**, such as armor-making, leatherworking, weapon-smithing, etc. With access to craftsman’s tools, the character can produce 40gp worth of items per month, and supervise 2 journeyman and 4 apprentices in his craft. When examining works of his craft, the craftpriest can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. Their **attention to detail** gives craftpriests a +3 bonus on proficiency rolls for other proficiencies they learn as well.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to **sensitivity to the rock and stone** around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may **detect traps**, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function. In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly **hardy people**. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Craftpriest Attack and Saving Throws table below. Dwarven characters speak the Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction with other races they can also speak Frost Giant, Dunish, Hendrical, and the Dark tounge of the Beastmen.

Starting at 5th level (Craft-Vicar), a craftpriest may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Craft-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs, and craft magical constructs such as golems. At 9th level, he also can construct a **vault** that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves of the character’s clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A Craft-Lord is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the **Campaign** chapter.

Deep into the earth the dwarves have delved, there discovering labyrinthine caverns and winding tunnels stretching hundreds and perhaps thousands of miles under the earth. Even the most exhaustive of dwarven maps has charted only a fraction of these tunnels, and most have never been trod by dwarven boots. The dwarven delver is one of the brave few dwarves that explore and map these sepulchral lands, so far from the warm forges of home. Confronted by the perils of cave-ins, beastmen, and dark threats unknown to the light of day, few delvers survive their first expedition. This only adds to the renown of those who do, attracting a new generation of foolhardy young dwarves to the perils of the darkness below.

Dwarven delvers are able combatants. Like thieves, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every *four* levels of experience. At first level, delvers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight wielding a weapon in either hand or a wielding a weapon two-handed, but cannot use shields. Valuing mobility and stealth over the false security of heavy armor, delvers wear only leather armor or lighter. They are trained to fight with all missile weapons and all axes, hammers, flails, and maces. They may use any magic item usable by thieves.

Dwarven delvers have several skills in common with the class of thieves, although these skills are not commonly employed for criminal enterprises. Because dwarven delvers prefer to evade foes where possible, they learn to **hide in shadows** and **move silently**. Chasms, sinkholes, and chimneys abound in the subterranean world, so every delver also learns **climb walls**. Decades of training in lightless environments teach delvers to **hear noises** that others miss. Subterranean dwellers are notorious for creating deadfalls, pits, and snares to capture or kill unwary trespassers, so dwarven delvers become expert at **finding traps**. (Unlike thieves, delvers generally avoid or bypass traps, and have no skill at disarming them.) Finally, a dwarven delver who catches an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows, may **backstab***.* When backstabbing, the delver receives an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deals additional damage for every four levels he has attained. The Dwarven Delver Level Progression table shows the target values by level for their thief skills.

By necessity, all dwarven delver are **expert cavers**, able to keep maps in their heads of where they are when exploring underground caves, cavern complexes, and rivers. On a proficiency throw of 9+, a delver will be able to automatically know the route he has taken to get where he is, if he was conscious at the time.

Dwarven delvers gain a +1 bonus on all surprise rolls when underground due to **sensitivity to the rock and stone** around them. When underground a delver can **detect false walls**, **hidden construction**, **or sloped passages** with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20, if actively searching.

Like all dwarves, delvers are **hardy people**. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Delver Attack and Saving Throws table below. Dwarven characters speak the Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction with other races they can also speak Frost Giant, Dunish, Hendrical, and the Dark tounge of the Beastmen.

When a dwarven delver reaches 9th level (Dwarven Pioneer), his reputation is such that he can attract dwarves from far and wide by constructing a new underground **vault** in an unsettled region. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character’s clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A dwarven delver is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. A delver’s vault follows all the rules for dwarven vaults detailed in the **Dwarven Vaults** section of Chapter 7 of *ACKS.*

While all dwarves share a predilection for mechanical devices, in some dwarves
this predilection is honed to an obsession. Dwarven machinists work wonders with
wood, metal, steam, and fire, crafting marvelous machines that move on their
own, lift great weights, and even fight their race’s foes.

The reasons why machinists leave the safety of the dwarven vaults to become
adventurers are varied. Some evil machinists are exiled for using their vaults
as personal laboratories for their capricious creations. At the other extreme,
some machinists use their devices to protect and serve the causes of Law where
it is most threatened. But most adventuring machinists are merely enterprising
sorts who seek to acquire resources, test experimental machines, and recover
lost devices.

_\*Hit point modifiers from constitution are ignored_

Relative to the renowned vaultguards of their race, dwarven machinists are only mediocre combatants. At first level, machinists hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every *four* levels of experience (i.e. the same as thieves). They may fight wielding a weapon and shield or a wielding a weapon two-handed, but cannot dual wield. Machinists may wear chain mail or lighter armor, but wield only a small range of weapons, including the arbalest, crossbow, dagger, hand axe, mace, and war hammer. They may use any magic item usable by thieves. 

It is not in combat, but in the construction and engineering of mechanical devices, that the true mastery of the dwarven machinist becomes evident.

At 1st level, every dwarven machinist is already a master craftsman in a particular type of mechanical craft, such as armor-making, clock-making, jewelling, weaponsmithing, etc. With access to craftsman’s tools, the character can produce 40gp worth of items per month, and supervise 2 journeymen and 3 apprentices in his craft. When examining works of his craft, the dwarven machinist can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 9+ on 1d20. Their **attention to detail** gives dwarven machinists a +3 bonus on proficiency rolls for other proficiencies they learn as well. (This bonus has already been factored in to the machinist’s class abilities.)

Regardless of their particular craft, all machinists are able to **open locks** and **find/remove traps** in the same manner as thieves, but doing so with a superior rate of success due to their attention to detail. Use the target values for these skills shown on the Dwarven Machinist Level Progression table, but otherwise apply all of the normal rules for these tasks (i.e. thieves’ tools are required and only one attempt is permitted per level). Note that a 1st level machinist will have a minimum chance of detecting traps of 14+ due to his default racial ability (described below), but will remove traps with a throw of 15+.

The most precious and valued secret of the dwarven machinist is his ability to **design, build, and repair automatons**. Automatons are machines similar to magical constructs, but using clockwork, steam engines, gears, and valves in place of dweomercraft.

**Designing Automatons:** Dwarven machinists may design new automatons. A successful design creates a **blueprint** that can guide their own or another machinist’s building process. The power of an automaton is measured by its Hit Dice and number of special abilities. Automatons must have a minimum of ½ HD. The machinist is limited to designing automatons with HD no more than twice his class level. Automatons may be designed with any number of special abilities up to the machinist’s class level.

Automatons have a default Armor Class equal to ½ their Hit Dice (rounded down). Increasing AC by two points counts as a special ability. Most automatons are immune to poison, gas, **charm**, **hold**, and **sleep** spells. These collectively count as one special ability. The automaton can be given additional immunities, such as immunity to fire, with each extra immunity counting as another special ability. Unlike constructs, automatons cannot be made immune to non-magical weapons. By default, automatons are mindless drones, simply following instructions in the same manner as a golem or animated undead. Some automatons actually require an operator; these are effectively equipment or vehicles, unable to act independently at all. If the automaton only functions with an operator, it may be treated as if it had one *less* special ability (to a minimum of zero; an automaton may not have ‘negative’ abilities).

By default, automatons have an exploration movement rate of 60’. The automaton may be designed to move faster if desired; each doubling of movement rate count as a special ability, to a maximum of 480’. If the automaton cannot move under its own power, it may be treated as if it had one *less* ability (to a minimum of zero). Movement is normally over land, via wheels, legs, or other mechanism. The automaton may be designed to burrow, climb, fly, and/or swim, but each of these counts as a special ability. If an automaton can hover while flying, it counts as 2 special abilities.

An automaton which requires an operator but moves under its own power must be built to carry at least one passenger (the operator). Adding the ability for the automaton to carry one passenger counts as one special ability; each doubling of passenger capacity counts as another special ability. Passengers are assumed to be carried in the open, as if mounted on an animal. The automaton may carry its passengers in a protected compartment, but this counts as an additional special ability. Characters in a protected compartment receive the AC of the automaton, or a +4 bonus to their own AC, whichever is better. 

Automatons normally have from one to four attacks per round. Their attacks may inflict up to three times their HD in maximum damage per round. For example, a 4 HD automaton may inflict up to 12 points of damage per round. This damage may  be divided among all their attacks as desired. Any special attacks or powers count as special abilities. An attack may be given a range of 10’ per point of maximum damage, but this counts as a special ability. An automaton that has no attacks at all may be treated as if it had one *less* special ability (minimum of zero). 

An automaton’s default weight is its Hit Dice squared x 10 stone. For instance, a ½ HD automaton will weigh 2.5 stone (25lb) while a 4 HD automaton will weigh 160 stone (1,600lb). Each doubling or halving of weight counts as a special ability. An automaton’s carrying capacity is equal to ½ its weight. Passengers, if any, count against this carrying capacity. 

Designing an automaton requires 2,000gp per Hit Die of the automaton, plus an additional 5,000gp for each special ability the automaton possesses. The design process takes one week, plus one day per 1,000gp of cost. Designing an automaton requires a proficiency throw against the target value listed on the Dwarven Machinist Level Progression table. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp of automaton cost.

To design an automaton, the dwarven machinist must have access to a research library at least equal in value to the cost of the automaton throughout the design process. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the automaton, the machinist receives a +1 bonus on his proficiency throw. A successful design creates a blueprint that the machinist can use to build the automaton (described below). 

EXAMPLE: Grimm, a 5th level dwarven machinist, wants to design a flying automaton, an ornithopter. He chooses to design it with only 2 HD, although the maximum permitted for his level is 10 HD. This gives the automaton a base cost of (2,000gp x 2) 4,000gp. At 2 HD, it has a default AC of 1. He assigns it standard automaton immunities, which counts as one special ability. Its default movement rate is 60’, but he increases this to 120’ (one special ability) with flying (one special ability). He adds the ability for his automaton to carry one passenger (one special ability). The automaton can inflict a maximum of 6 damage per round, but Grimm decides to forgo giving his automaton any attacks, which means his automaton will count as having one less special ability. To keep his automaton affordable, he requires it to have an operator, again meaning the automaton will count as having one less special ability. His automaton has a total of (1+1+1+1-1-1) 2 special abilities.

The cost to design the automaton with its special abilities is (4,000gp + 5,000gp x 2) 14,000gp. It will take 21 days to design the construct (1 week + 14,000/1,000). The proficiency throw value to design the ornithopter is 12+ (base 10+ plus 14,000/5,000). Grimm will need to seek out a research library worth at least 14,000gp to complete the design, and can gain a bonus to his throw if the library is of great worth.

When designed, the ornithopter has the following characteristics: AC 1, Move 120’ flying, HD 2, \# AT -, Dmg -; immune to poison, gas, charm, hold, sleep; carry one passenger; requires operator; weight 40 stone (400 lbs); carrying capacity 20 stone.

**Building Automatons:** Building an automaton requires 2,000gp per Hit Die of the automaton, plus an additional 5,000gp for each special ability the automaton possesses. The machinist is limited to creating automatons with HD no more than twice his class level and with a number of special abilities no greater than his class level. The machinist must have either a blueprint or a sample of the type of automaton he wishes to create. Blueprints can be found as treasure in rare manuals, or developed by the machinists (as described above). The remains of an automaton destroyed in battle can serve as a sample.

The construction takes one week, plus one day per 1,000gp of cost. Building an automaton requires a proficiency throw against the target value listed on the Dwarven Machinist Level Progression table. The target value for this throw is increased by +1 for every 5,000gp of automaton cost. 

To build an automaton, the machinist must have access to a workshop at least equal in value to the cost of the automaton throughout the construction. For every 10,000gp of value above the minimum required for the automaton, the machinist receives a +1 bonus on his proficiency throw. For every 10,000gp of quality materials (precious metals, specially treated woods, etc.) added to the construction process, the machinist receives a +1 bonus on his proficiency throw. A machinist may not spend more on quality materials than the base cost of the automaton.

EXAMPLE: Ravik, a 7th level dwarven machinist, finds the wrecked remains of Grimm’s ornithopter. He uses this as a sample to build an ornithopter of his own. The cost to construct the ornithopter is (2,000gp x 2) + (5,000gp x 2) 14,000gp, and the time required is (7 + 14,000gp/1,000) 21 days. Ravik’s proficiency throw to build the ornithopter is 10+ (8+ base plus 14,000/5,000). Being quite wealthy, Ravik has a workshop worth 35,000gp. This gives him a +2 bonus on his proficiency throw (35,000 – 14,000)/(10,000). He decides to lavish 10,000gp on rare hardwood for the construction, gaining an additional +1. Ravik will be able to construct the ornithopter on a roll of 7+.

**Repairing Automatons:** Being machines, automatons do not heal naturally and cannot be magically cured. However, the dwarven machinist can repair his class level of damage with a successful proficiency throw. Performing repairs takes one hour. An automaton reduced to 0hp or less is destroyed and cannot be repaired.

When a dwarven machinist reaches 9th level (Master Machinist), he can establish a **manufactory** and begin training apprentices. He will then attract 1d6 apprentice machinists of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 dwarves seeking to become machinists. Their Intelligence and Dexterity scores will be above average, but many will find they lack the talent and quit after 1d6 months. Apprentices function like assistants in magical research (see *ACKS* p. 119). While in the dwarven machinist’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the dwarven machinist builds a **dungeon** beneath or near his manufactory, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within. These are often used to test new automatons. Machinists’ manufactories are otherwise identical to mages’ sanctums, as detailed in the **Campaign** chapter of the *ACKS* Rulebook.

Like other dwarves, machinists gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to **sensitivity to the rock and stone** around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may **detect traps**, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function. 

As dwarves, machinists are particularly **hardy**. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the Dwarven Machinist Attack and Saving Throws table below. Dwarven characters speak the Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction with other races they can also speak Frost Giant, Dunish, Hendrical, and the Dark tounge of the Beastmen.

## Giantkin Bastard

| Prime Requisite: | STR and CON

The last remnant of the Giantkin invasion, unloved and resented by those around them are the bastards left behind. The giantkin are massive specimens of humanity – standing seven feet tall and possessing great might. Given their origin giantkin are widely feared and reviled after the war. Giantkin bastards suffer a -2 penalty to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of humans and demi-humans they interact with. 

Giantkin Bastards are monstrously powerful combatants. Enormously strong they get an extra +1 damage with melee weapons with another +1 at 5th and 9th level, +4 bonus to break things and similar feats of strength. With their great frame and stride, they can move 30' faster than normal and carry an extra 5 stone in weight. However there are drawbacks to this, with Armor costing double normal and weighing 25% more. With such endurance a giantkin is nearly tireless. He does not need to rest every 6 turns. He can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of Constitution bonus. Finally a thickened skin gives a bonus +1 AC, but slows down their response time which gives a -1 initiative.

The bastard advances in attack throws by two points every three levels. The giantkin bastard can use an unrestricted selection of weapons and armor, and may fight in any style, including two weapons, weapons and shields, and two-handed weapons. The class gains +1 to damage rolls at level 1, and +1 every three levels thereafter. The Bastard may perform one cleave attack per level, this is in addition to the +1 damage earlier.

At 9th level (Brutal Warlord), a giantkin bastard can build a **war camp** and attract fighters, both giantkin and human, with his sheer battle prowess. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level human mercenaries and 1d6 giantkin bastards of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the ACKS **Campaign** chapter.

Left behind, the smaller and more cunning of the giantkin have found a niche as the enforcers and thugs for criminals. On the small side for Giantkin at a mere six foot six inches tall with might to match these giantkin are threatening to all around them. Given their origin giantkin are widely feared and reviled after the war. Giantkin misbegotten suffer a -2 penalty to the reactions, loyalty, and morale of humans and demi-humans they interact with. 

Giantkin misbegotten are powerful combatants. Enormously strong they get an extra +1 damage with melee weapons with another +1 at 5th and 9th level, +4 bonus to break things and similar feats of strength. With their great frame and stride, they can move 30' faster than normal and carry an extra 5 stone in weight. However there are drawbacks to this, with Armor costing double normal and weighing 25% more. With such endurance a giantkin is nearly tireless. He does not need to rest every 6 turns. He can force march for one day without penalty, plus one additional day for each point of Constitution bonus. Finally a thickened skin gives a bonus +1 AC, but slows down their response time which gives a -1 initiative.

Giantkin Misbegotten are ruthless, dirty combatants. At first level, misbegotten hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like thieves, they advance in attack throws by two points every *four* levels of experience. In addition they advance in saving throws like thieves, by two points every *four* levels of experience. The can make 1 cleave per two levels of experience.

All giantkin misbegotten may wear leather armor or lighter, and may wield bows / crossbows and Swords / Daggers, but may not use shields. They may only use magic items usable by thieves.

Lacking the staying power of fighters, misbegotten prefer to strike from ambush and finish their foes quickly. A giantkin misbegotten whose opponent is unaware of his presence can **backstab** him. When backstabbing, the freebooter receives an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deals additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A freebooter at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.

Due to his exposure to the seedy life of the streets, the misbegotten has a number of thief-like skills such as hideingin shadows, moving silently, opening locks, climbing Walls, hearing noises and picking pockets. The misbegotten is a cut-throat and killer. He can cut the purses of passersby, skulk in the shadows to waylay unsuspecting victims, break into homes and burglarize their valuables, or simply rely on his threatening demeanor and martial prowess to rob victims at sword-point. Most misbegotten can be found in any den of scum and villainy.

**Hiding in Shadows**: A thief may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A thief will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.

**Opening Locks**: With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief may pick mechanical locks. He may only try to pick a particular lock once, and if he fails, he may not try the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the lock.

**Picking Pockets**: This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves for it is a quick source of income - though not without peril. A throw that is less than half the target value means that the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim's reaction.

**Moving Silently**: Thieves may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Thieves may move silently at  1/2  their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than  1/2  speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.

**Hearing Noises**: Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway and at a door or other locations. The thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment.

**Climbing Walls**: Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Thieves climb at ¼ their standard combat movement rate.

When a misbegotten attains 9th level (ThiefLord), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 misbegotten or human thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. A successful character might use these followers to start a Thieves’ Guild. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the Campaign chapter.

## Alignment

In the Adventurer Conqueror King System, your character will enter a world of ceaseless violent struggle, where civilization is ever-assailed by forces intent on its destruction. In this perilous realm, he will be called to choose a side: Will he pledge to defend civilization and its allies against those who seek to destroy it? Will he sell his sword to any who can offer fame or fortune? Or will he become an agent of entropy and destruction undermining peace and order? This choice is called Alignment, and the three choices are Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.

**Law**: Lawful beings believe that civilization is worth fighting for. Despite its vices and villainies, civilization must be defended against those who would destroy it. Lawful beings tend to see wars among civilizations as aiding the cause of Chaos, and so they seek peace among Lawful civilizations where possible. However, Lawful characters are not pacifists, nor are they necessarily altruists. Indeed, most would think something was wrong with a hero who turned down fame and fortune; chests of gold, magnificent weapons, comely consorts, and grants of land are, after all, the rightful rewards for great deeds of valor on behalf of Law.

**Neutrality**: Neutral beings generally enjoy the benefits of law and civilization, but it is not something they directly fight for. They tend to focus on their own ends, whether those are family, fame, fortune, pleasure, or power. A Neutral mercenary might be found fighting on behalf of Law or Chaos; a neutral farmer tends his crops and pays his taxes, whether to the Patriarch or the Lich-King.

**Chaos**: Chaotic beings actively seek to destroy civil society. Chaotic characters are often madmen or cultists of forgotten, chthonic gods. To the extent they have any order at all, societies of Chaotic characters are ruled by force and fear, and are often characterized by all manner of corruption and vice. Even decadent Lawful civilizations at least pay homage to civilizing virtue, but chaotic civilizations embrace their corruption.

Note that a character's choice of Alignment doesn't determine whether or not he takes care of his children, cheats on his wife, or steals from the merchant's guild. It is concerned only with the weighty issue of where his allegiance lies in the grand struggles of existence. To have an alignment of Lawful or Chaotic is to have chosen a side in this perpetual struggle. Many people, choosing no side, are Neutral, although it is important to remember that most Neutrals still want the protection of Law even though they are not willing to die for it. (To paraphrase George Orwell, Neutral humans sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because Lawful heroes stand ready to do violence on their behalf.)

Human vices, such as greed, lust, and vanity, are widespread and common even in Lawful societies. But Chaotic societies are characterized by their monstrous vices: Genocide, human sacrifice, wanton destruction, cannibalism, necrophilia, and so on. Evil is all-too-human in every civilization, but Chaotic is something both less and more than human.

## Adventuring Parties

The worlds is dangerous and hostile, for the sake of survival, characters team up to undertake adventures because any number or type of monsters could lie in wait. Such groups, known as adventuring parties, are generally composed of a diverse array of classes, so that different characters are able to contribute their specific talents for any given situation. A thief can check for traps, for instance, and fighters are good for muscle. Clerics have spells for healing and divination, while mages are capable of powerful offensive and defensive magic.

Occasionally, there are not enough party members to take on the challenges of an adventure. The party may hire NPCs, such as henchmen or mercenaries, for extra hands. The rules for hiring henchmen and mercenaries are discussed in Chapter 3, Equipment.

When there are only a small number of players, the Judge may allow them to each play more than one character. Nevertheless, in these cases characters belonging to the same player cannot offer each other special treatment, such as trading or giving away riches or magical items, unless the Judge rules it acceptable.
