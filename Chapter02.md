# Chapter 2: Characters


## Creating a Character

You've taken the first step on your adventure, but you are still a 0th level human. Don't despair, because you become 1st level when you create your first character, and progress from there! To create a character, follow the nine steps below:

1. Start with a fresh character sheet. You can copy the one provided in this book, download and print one, or reproduce it by hand on a piece of paper. If all else fails, just scribble down notes on scratch paper!

2. Roll 3d6 in order for your character's ability scores, as described below under Character Abilities, and write the results after the names of the abilities. Write down the ability score bonus or penalty for each score, as shown on the [Ability Score](Chapter02.md#ability-score) table.

3. Choose a class which suits your character's abilities from the [Character Classes](Chapter02.md#character-classes) section. All classes have prime requisites, and some classes require minimum scores for some abilities. If abilities are not quite high enough for the class you would like to play, see [Classes and Ability Scores](Chapter02.md#classes-and-ability-scores) for some options to adjust your scores. Write down the special abilities of your class, as described for each class.

4. Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0) experience points (or XP); you may also want to note the number needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for your class. Gaining experience points is explained in the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) and [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapters.

5. Roll hit points (hp) using the appropriate die for your class, adding your Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit points on your character sheet. If your character has a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not lower any Hit Die roll below 1. (At your Judge's discretion, you may begin with the maximum hit points for 1st level.)

6. Record your character's attack throws and saving throws on your character sheet. Attack throws and saving throws are listed with each class, and described fully in the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) chapter. Note that attacks with melee weapons are modified by your Strength, while missile weapons such as bows or thrown daggers are modified by Dexterity. Don't forget to adjust your attack throws to reflect these modifiers.

7. Choose your character's starting proficiencies from the [Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies) chapter. Apply any modifiers to your ability scores, hit points, attack throws, or saving throws from proficiencies. If you have chosen to play a mage or elven spellsword, roll for your starting spells, as described in the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter.

8. Generate your character's starting wealth by rolling 3d6x10 gold pieces (gp) and purchase equipment for your character from the lists in the [Equipment](Chapter03.md#chapter-3-equipment) chapter. Write your purchases on your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward. Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for your class before making your purchases. Since you now know what armor your character is wearing, note your Armor Class (AC) on the character sheet based on the type of armor you choose. Don't forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to AC. Likewise, record your weapon damages based on the type of weapons you choose, modified by your Strength bonus or penalty. Calculate your character's encumbrance based on how much weight he is carrying.

9. Give your character a name, and create a description of what your character looks like, his personality, and maybe even a brief note about the character's background. Then choose an appropriate Alignment for your character. Your Judge will have information on the setting of your character's world that can be helpful in naming your new character and developing his background.


### Generating Multiple Characters (Optional)

As an optional rule, at the start of play, each player generates five characters and select one primary and two back-up characters. The remaining two characters are given to the Judge to use as NPCs to populate the campaign setting. If the primary and back-ups are all killed, the player generates five additional characters, again picking three and giving the Judge two. This ensures that the player always has a variety of characters to choose from to find one he likes, and gives the Judge some additional NPCs to populate the world.


## Character Abilities

Character Abilities must be determined by rolling randomly. Roll 3d6 for each ability in the order listed below. As an optional rule, the Judge may allow you to roll 6 scores and then assign them to your abilities in any order you desire.

When complete, your character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has one or more prime requisite ability scores, which affect the rate at which the character will earn experience points. Some class may have other minimum ability requirements which must be met in addition.

#### Ability Score

| Ability Score | Bonus/Penalty
| :------------ | ------------:
| 3             |            -3
| 4-5           |            -2
| 6-8           |            -1
| 9-12          |             0
| 13-15         |            +1
| 16-17         |            +2
| 18            |            +3

**Strength**: As the name implies, this ability measures the character's raw physical power. Strength is a prime requisite for assassins, explorers, dwarven vaultguards, elven spellswords, and fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to all attack throws and damage rolls in melee (hand-to-hand) combat. Note that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful attack below one point, unless the target is otherwise invulnerable to the attack (see the [Adventures](Chapter06.md#chapter-6-adventures) chapter for details).

**Intelligence**: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge. Intelligence is a prime requisite for elven nightblades, elven spellswords, and mages. The ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of proficiencies the character begins play with (see the [Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies) chapter for details) and the number of languages the character is able to learn to read and write, as described below. Mages, elven nightblades, and elven spellswords increase the number of spells of each level in their repertoire by their Intelligence bonus (see the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for details).

All characters begin the game knowing their native language. In most campaign worlds, the majority of humans speak a common language, often called "Common."  The demi-human races (elves and dwarves) have their own languages, and members of these  races normally begin play knowing their racial language, Common (or the local human language if it isn't called Common), and certain other languages based on the race.

A character with an Intelligence penalty will only know his native language, and cannot read more than a word or two. Characters with at least average Intelligence (9-12) will be literate in any languages they can speak. Characters with an Intelligence bonus may begin the game knowing one or more languages other than those given above; the number of additional languages that may be learned is equal to the Intelligence bonus (+1, +2, or +3). The player may also choose to leave one or more bonus language "slots" open, to be filled during play.

The languages available to characters include the demi-human languages (Elven, Dwarven, Gnomish, and Halfling) and the various beastmen dialects (e.g. Orc, Goblin). At the Judge's discretion, player characters may also begin play knowing ancient or archaic tongues, or exotic languages such as Draconic (the language of dragons). The specific languages available will depend on the campaign setting.

**Wisdom**: A combination of intuition, willpower and common sense. Wisdom is a prime requisite for bladedancers, clerics, and dwarven craftpriests. The Wisdom bonus or penalty applies to saving throws caused by spells or magic items. This would include, e.g., a save versus Blast against a fireball or a save versus Death from a finger of death, but not a save versus Petrification against a medusa's gaze.

**Dexterity**: This ability measures the character's quickness and balance as well as his aptitude with tools. Dexterity is a prime requisite for assassins, bards, bladedancers, elven nightblades, explorers, and thieves. A character's Dexterity bonus or penalty is applied to his attack throws with missile weapons, Armor Class value, and Initiative die rolls.

**Constitution**: Constitution is a combination of general health and vitality. Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each Hit Die rolled by the character. Note that a penalty here cannot reduce any Hit Die roll to less than 1 point.

**Charisma**: This is the ability to influence or even lead people; those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly respected. Charisma is a prime requisite for bards. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to the character's reaction rolls. Charisma also determines the maximum number of henchmen the character may employ, and modifies their morale. The number of henchmen a character may hire is equal to 4 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty (and therefore ranges from 1 to 7); the average morale of any such henchmen will be 0, modified by the character's Charisma bonus or penalty.


### Classes and Ability Scores

Once abilities have been determined, each player must choose a class. Each class has one or more prime requisite ability scores. A character must have an ability score of at least 9 in a class's prime requisite(s) in order to choose a particular class. Some classes have additional minimum ability score requirements. A character must have the minimum required ability, if one is indicated, in order to choose a particular class.

If a character's prime requisite ability is high enough, the character will receive a bonus to experience points earned during play. The [Ability Prime Requisite](Chapter02.md#ability-prime-requisite) table, below, details the effect a score in a prime requisite has on experience points earned by characters. If a class has two prime requisites, calculate the character's experience adjustment based on whichever prime requisite has the lower ability score.

#### Ability Prime Requisite

| Score | Experience Adjustment
| :---- | --------------------:
| 9-12  |                    0%
| 13-15 |                   +5%
| 16-18 |                  +10%

Once a player has selected his character class, he may raise the class's prime requisite ability or abilities if desired by sacrificing points in other abilities. 2 ability points may be sacrificed from an ability to raise a prime requisite ability 1 point. This may be done more than once, but no ability can be lowered below 9, and no ability may be lowered if it is also a prime requisite for the class, even if there are a few points to spare above the minimum required score.


## Hit Points

Hit points are a measure of a character's ability to survive in combat. When a character, or any other being, is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he is incapacitated and possibly dead. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character's capacity to receive physical injury. Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant.

Each character class rolls a different kind of die to determine hit points, as noted in the [Character Classes](Chapter02.md#character-classes) section, based on their toughness in battle. One die is rolled at first level, and further dice are rolled and cumulatively added to the total hp for each level of experience, unless otherwise noted. One optional rule, to allow first level characters to be hardier, is for the Judge to allow all hp rolls for first level characters to be considered the maximum result (e.g. an 8 for fighters or a 6 for clerics.)


## Character Classes

In the Adventurer Conqueror King System, there are two types of classes: human classes and demi-human classes. Humans are the most widespread of all races. Their ambition, cunning, and courage have led them to settle most of the known world, so most characters in the game will belong to one of the human classes.

The core human classes described in these rules are the fighter, mage, cleric, and thief. Four additional human classes, the assassin, bard, bladedancer, and explorer, are provided to show how the core classes can be customized for specific archetypes within a campaign setting.

Compared to humans, demi-humans are rare, and generally more specialized. Demi-human classes are defined by their race, with different classes available for dwarves, elves, and other demi-humans. The demi-human classes described in these rules are the dwarven vaultguard, dwarven craftpriest, elven spellsword, and elven nightblade.

Selecting equipment and proficiencies can be time-consuming, especially for new players. As a faster alternative, we offer a pre-generated template for each class, with weapons, armor, equipment, proficiencies, and spells ready for play. If you want to use these templates, you can skip step 8 (picking proficiencies and spells) and 9 (rolling for starting wealth and purchasing equipment) of character generation and simply use the template. A variety of additional templates, new classes, and rules for creating customized classes are available in the Adventurer Conqueror King System Player's Companion, available separately from Autarch.


## Core Classes


### Fighter

| Prime Requisite: | STR
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d8
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Fighters are exclusively trained in the arts of combat and war. They are specialists at dealing physical blows. Fighters may have learned their arts as warriors, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. Fighters are trained in the use of all weapons and armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, or wielding a weapon in each hand, as desired. At first level, fighters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (the best progression of any class). Fighters also increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

When a fighter reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his battlefield prowess inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter's Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Warlord), a fighter can, assuming enough gold is at hand, build a castle and become a great leader of men, taking a leadership rank in his society. When he does so, up 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 fighters of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Through force of arms, the fighter may ultimately control several castles or even entire realms, but must be a capable, strong leader and provide protection. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.


| Template:           | Mercenary
| :------------------ | :--------
| Proficiencies:      | Combat Reflexes, Manual of Arms
| Starting Equipment: | Well-oiled sword, metal shield re-painted many times, slightly battered chainmail armor, crossbow, case with 20 quarrels,  military tunic, boots, backpack, 2 week's iron rations

This pre-generated template represents a wary sellsword. The template is ready for adventure. However, if your fighter's INT is 13 or greater, you may pick one or more additional general proficiencies before play if you'd like (see [Starting Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#starting-proficiencies) in Chapter 4).


#### Fighter Level Progression

| Experience | Title             | Level | Hit Dice | Damage Bonus

### Thief

| Prime Requisite: | DEX
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Thieves have a range of unique skills associated with their profession that make them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves can be a bit shady and they sometimes are not as trustworthy as other classes. A thief will usually belong to a Thieves' Guild from the character's local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. At the Judge's discretion, a thief may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. Thieves are everywhere, from the slums to the highest halls of the government.

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first level, thieves hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. Because of their need for stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands.

A thief also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the thief will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A thief at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.

Thieves have the following range of skills, which improve as the thief gains levels according to the progression on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table. When a thief attempts to make use of one of his skills, the character or Judge will make a proficiency throw of 1d20. (Usually the Judge will make rolls for these abilities, because a thief is not always aware when he has failed.) After applying any relevant modifiers (e.g. due to the complexity of a lock), the result is compared to the target value listed on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table below for the appropriate skill. A result that is greater than or equal to the value listed for the proficiency throw that corresponds to the thief's level is a success. A roll of 20 is always a success, and a roll of 1 is always a failure.

**Opening Locks**: With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief may pick mechanical locks. He may only try to pick a particular lock once, and if he fails, he may not try the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the lock.

**Finding and Removing Traps**: Through careful inspection and probing, a thief may find hidden traps and then attempt to disable or discharge the trap harmlessly. A thief may only try to find or remove a trap once in any given area. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the trap. If the thief fails, he may not try again until he reaches a higher experience level. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he can remove it.

**Picking Pockets**: This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves for it is a quick source of income - though not without peril. A throw that is less than half the target value means that the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim's reaction.

**Moving Silently**: Thieves may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Thieves may move silently at  1/2  their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than  1/2  speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.

**Climbing Walls**: Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Thieves climb at  1/4  their standard combat movement rate.

**Hiding in Shadows**: A thief may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A thief will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.

**Hearing Noises**: Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway and at a door or other locations. The thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment.

Upon attaining 4th level, a thief gains the ability to read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a thief attains 9th level (Master Thief), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. A successful character might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, a thief can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

## Campaign Classes

### Bard

| Prime Requisite: | DEX and CHA
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Successful adventurers live forever in the sagas and songs about their deeds. Remembering and recounting these sagas is the profession of bards. Most bards are content to recite the deeds of others, but some bold few participate in the dangers themselves and become inspiring heroes in their own right. A bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald, or haughty aristocrat.

Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws as a thief, by two points every four levels of experience. At first level, bards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wield a weapon in each hand if desired. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields.

All bards can sing, recite poetry, or play a group of instruments in a skilled manner. The bard chooses the type of performance that his character knows. A bard may take the Perform proficiency to learn other types of performances (see [Chapter 4, Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies)).

By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires  a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the bard's allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring epic gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

Because of their study of ancient annals and legends, bards possess loremastery. This knowledge allows them to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a bard must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in these tasks. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level.

This same knowledge allows bards to dabble in the arcane. They may attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic Items only useable by mages. At 1st level, the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge's discretion). The proficiency throw required reduces by 2 per level, to a minimum of 3+.

Upon attaining 4th level (Annalist), the bard gains the ability to read languages, including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings. A proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20 is required. If the roll does not succeed, the bard may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a bard reaches 5th level (Chronicler), his chronicles of battle inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the bard is there to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard's Charisma or proficiencies.

Upon reaching 9th level (Bard), a bard can build a hall and become a ruler. When he does so, up 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 bards of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Additional rules for halls are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, the bard can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.


| Template:           | Wandering Minstrel

This pre-generated template represents a wandering minstrel with magic in his song. The template is ready for adventure. However, if your bard's INT is 13 or greater, you may pick one or more additional general proficiencies before play if you'd like (see [Starting Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#starting-proficiencies) in Chapter 4).

## Human Chosen

Prime Requisite: Lowest ability score
Requirements: Any ability score 18
Hit Dice: 1d6
Maximum Level: 14

Some men and women, whether out of desire for wealth, or fame, or power, or mere wanderlust, choose to be adventurers. But others are **chosen**, their paths guided by great powers toward heroic roads that lead them to everlasting glory—or ignominious death. A chosen can appear anywhere and at any time. The humblest farm boy is as likely to be marked by fate as the scion of a king. Chosen are, however, quite rare; fewer than 1 in 1,000 adventurers are chosen, and most people will live their entire lives without ever seeing one. When they do appear, they inevitably draw the attention of the great powers of light and darkness, ever ready to anoint a new champion or preemptively slay a new foe before he can come into the fullness of his power.

To qualify as a chosen, a character must have at least one natural ability score of 18. The chosen’s prime requisite is his lowest ability score. Since a character must have an ability score of at least 9 in a class’s prime requisite(s) in order to choose a particular class, a character must have at least 9 in every ability score or he cannot become a chosen. A chosen must always be of Lawful alignment. A chosen who changes to Neutral or Chaotic alignment loses all his gifts. (At the Judge’s discretion, Chaotic chosen may be permitted, who work for the powers of darkness.)

\*Hit point modifiers from Constitution are ignored

Chosen are blessed with an instinctive natural aptitude for combat. At first level, chosen hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Whether from preternatural skill or uncanny link, chosen increase their base damage roll from successful melee and missile attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. A chosen can fight with a two-handed weapon, a weapon in each hand, or a weapon and shield, as desired.

Despite their talents, most chosen begin their adventuring careers with limited knowledge of arms and armor. Chosen may only wear hide or lighter armor, and may only fight with bolas, clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, nets, slings, saps, and staffs. However, a chosen may use one or more gifts (see below) to train in the use of better armor or weapons, either at 1st level or later.

Every chosen receives **gifts** from the powers that have chosen him. Some gifts reveal themselves in overtly magical displays; other gifts may manifest as merely an instinctive aptitude for learning of particular skills, enabling the chosen to master in mere months what takes others a lifetime to learn.

At 1st level (Innocent), a chosen begins with three gifts. With each level of experienced gained thereafter, the number of gifts bestowed upon by the chosen increases, as shown on the Chosen Level Progression table.

Just as each chosen has a different destiny, so each has a different set of gifts. Chosen select their gifts from the list below. All selections must be approved by the Judge. Some gifts may be banned from particular settings where they are inappropriate or where they refer to optional rules that the Judge has opted not to use. Chosen can only select the same gift multiple times at the same level with the Judge’s approval.

**Chosen Gifts**

*Armor Training:* The chosen trains to fight in armor. This gift may be selected multiple times. If selected once, the chosen can wear leather armor. If selected twice, the chosen can wear chain mail armor. If selected thrice, the chosen can wear plate armor.

*Aura of Protection:* The chosen gains a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The chosen’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with **detect good**, **detect magic**, or **true seeing**.

*Boon Companion:* Whenever an ally within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to allow the ally to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the ally can never re-roll a natural 1.

*Ceremonial Magic:* The chosen has learned the ceremonies of a particular tradition of ceremonial magic (antiquarian, liturgical, runic, sylvan, shamanic, or theurgical). The chosen must choose the tradition at the time he chooses the gift. When this gift is selected, the chosen becomes a 1st level ceremonialist with a repertoire of one 1st level ceremony. He can perform ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a 1st level ceremonialist, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each subsequent time it is selected, the chosen can either reduce the proficiency throw required to identify trinkets and talismans of a tradition he already knows by 4; learn another tradition; add one ceremony (of any level he can perform) to his repertoire; or increase his ceremonialist caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of ceremonies.

*Charismatic Ferocity:* When attacking with one-handed melee weapons or thrown weapons, the chosen may apply his CHA modifier instead of his STR modifier on his damage rolls.

*Chosen Weapon:* The chosen can designate a particular individual weapon as his chosen weapon. The chosen weapon must be given a name (e.g. “Excalibur” or “Anduril”). When the chosen wields his chosen weapon, it is treated as if its magical bonus to attack and damage were 1 point greater. This gift may be selected multiple times, but no more than once at 1st to 4th level, twice at 5th to 9th level, and thrice at 10th level and above. Each time it is selected the chosen can increase the bonus of his chosen weapon or designate an additional weapon as a chosen weapon.

*Cleansing Touch:* By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly remove a curse or dispel a harmful magical effect. The chosen must be of equal or greater level than the spellcaster who cast the curse or effect.

*Courage:* The chosen has mastered his fear and will never shirk from his destiny. He is immune to normal and magical fear effects.

*Destined:* The chosen gains two Fate Points. This gift may be selected multiple times.

*Determined:* The chosen may spend a Fate Point after making an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw to set the result of the throw to 10 (instead of re-rolling). The chosen cannot spend a Fate Point in this manner if the original roll was a natural 1, however.

*Divine Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, and Sensing Evil. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.

*Eldritch Talent:* The chosen manifests the ability to cast an eldritch spell at certain intervals. The spell selected may be of any level, up to the chosen’s level of experience. The spell is cast as if the chosen were of the minimum caster level for the spell. The frequency with which the chosen can cast is determined by the spells’ level. 1st – once per hour; 2nd – once per 8 hours; 3rd – once per day; 4th – once per week; 5th – once per month; 6th – once per year. The chosen does not have a spellbook and cannot change his repertoire. This gift does not allow the chosen to use scrolls or magic items usable only by mages or clerics. This proficiency can be selected multiple times to gain the ability to cast additional spells.

*Eldritch Warrior:* When the chosen successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend a spell to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell expended. The chosen must have gained spellcasting abilities from the Eldritch Talent gift before selecting this gift.

*Farseeing:* The chosen can see the fates of mortals. He may determine how many Fate Points a character has after 10 minutes (1 turn) of casual interaction or observation. Once per week, the chosen may cast **fate** (as the spell) with a casting time of 10 minutes (1 turn).

*Friends of Birds and Beasts*: The chosen can understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character). This gives the chosen a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals, and allows him to take animals as henchmen. The chosen can also identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+.

*Gift of Tongues:* The chosen has a gift for learning new tongues. Each time this gift is selected, he may learn four additional languages.

*Hard to Kill:* When a chosen is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. The chosen also subtract his class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.

*Healing Touch:* By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly heal the creature by an amount equal to his Base Healing Rate or the creature’s Base Healing Rate, whichever is less.

*Inspiring:* By reciting heroic lays or stirring words for a few moments before a battle (one round), a chosen can grant his allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the character), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A chosen can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. A chosen cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

*Invulnerable:* The chosen is blessed with partial invulnerability to harm. Any damage the chosen suffers from non-magical attacks is reduced by 1 point per die. The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity. This gift can be selected up to three times. Each additional time the gift is selected, damage suffered is reduced by 1 additional point per die, to a maximum of 3 points per die.

*Lion-Hearted:* If the chosen is serving as a commander or hero on the battlefield with an army, the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. This benefit is lost for the duration of the battle, however, if the chosen himself routs, flees, or leads from the rear (see Domains at War: Battles, p. XX).

*Lucky:* When re-rolling attack throws, proficiency throws, or saving throws using Fate Points, the chosen may roll the die twice and choose the better value.

*Keen Eyes:* The chosen can detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection.

*Magical Music*: The chosen gains the ability to sing spells. He gets two spell points and has one 1st level eldritch spell in his repertoire, which he casts as a 1st level spellsinger. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each time the gif its selected, the character can either increase his caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level; or gain two spell points and add one additional eldritch spell (of any level he can spellsing) to his repertoire. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of spellsinging spells.

*Magical Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Battle Magic, Collegiate Wizardry, Elementalism, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, or Unflappable Casting. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.

*Martial Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alertness, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery, Fighting Style, Precise Shooting, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections.

*Martial Talent:* The chosen has a native aptitude for weapons. The chosen gains a +1 bonus to attack throws with his choice of either melee or missile attacks. This gift can be selected twice, once for melee and once for missile attacks.

*Martial Training:* The chosen has had training in use of arms. This gift may be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected, choose one of the following types of weapons and add these to the list of weapons permitted to the character: (1) axes; (2) bows/crossbows; (3) flails/hammers/maces; (4) swords/daggers; (5) spears/pole arms; (6) any four weapons.

*Meditative Focus:* The chosen can go into a state of intense Zen-like focus once per day per level of experience. While in focus, the character gains a +1 bonus to all attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls. A meditative focus lasts for 1 turn (10 minutes).

*Military Genius:* The chosen commands the battlefield like a god of war. He gains a permanent +1 bonus to his strategic ability, leadership ability, and morale modifier when commanding troops on the battlefield.

*Mystical Bloodline*: The chosen is the scion of an otherworldly or inhuman power. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s lifespan is extend to three times longer than normal, and he ceases to show further signs of aging. He also gains the elf’s immunity to paralysis. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s ancestry manifests somehow in his appearance (pointed ears, golden eyes, a strange birthmark, or other unusual trait.)

*Scion of Kings:* The blood of ancient lords flows in the chosen’s veins. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.

*Second Sight:* The chosen has a connection to the hidden world, and can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the chosen can see them, and may often take a particular interest in him as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see characters hiding in shadows, secret doors, traps, or other creatures or objects hidden through cover and concealment, but does provide a +4 bonus to saving throws to disbelieve illusions.

*Student of War:* The chosen can select one proficiency, choosing Command, Military Strategy, Leadership, or Siege Engineering. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency or proficiency rank each time.

*Sworn Foe:* When this gift is selected, the chosen must designate one specific individual monster or NPC by its name or unique physical characteristic (e.g. “the six-fingered man”). That creature becomes his sworn foe. The chosen gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and saving throws when confronting his sworn foe. If the chosen lands a successful attack on his sworn foe (including spells), the chosen can spend a Fate Point to deal double damage with the attack. If the sworn foe lands a successful attack on the chosen, the chosen can spend a Fate Point to halve the damage dealt by the attack. Once a chosen defeats his sworn foe, he may name a new sworn foe at any time thereafter. A sworn foe must have at least equal HD or levels of experience than the chosen; if the chosen ever surpasses his sworn foe in level or HD, he must select a new foe.

*Thievery Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Acrobatics, Alertness, Ambushing, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Contortionism, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Passing Without Trace, Running, Skulking, and Trap Finding. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections.

*Thievery Training:* The chosen can select one thief skill, choosing from Find Traps, Hide in Shadows, Move Silently, Open Locks, Pick Pockets, and Remove Traps. Thereafter the chosen can perform this skill as a thief of his level. This proficiency may be selected multiple times to gain additional thief skills, to a maximum limit of three selections.

*Tribulating Adversary:* Whenever an enemy within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to force the enemy to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the chosen can never force a re-roll of a natural 20.

*Wholeness of Body:* The chosen is immune to all forms of poison, including magical poisons.

When a chosen reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his **sense of destiny** inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the chosen gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the chosen’s Charisma, proficiencies, or class powers.

At 9th level (Chosen), a chosen can **establish a stronghold** and become a protector of men. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries.

### Explorer

| Prime Requisite: | STR and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Explorers are scouts and trackers, adept at both woodcraft and archery. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. An explorer might be a long range scout, a barbarian hunter from the northern forests, or a settler pushing past the borders civilization.

While they prefer to evade foes where possible, explorers are cunning warriors when they need to be. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. At first level, explorers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. In addition, they gain an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Explorers are trained to fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wear chain mail or lighter armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Explorers have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Outdoors, explorers are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, an explorer who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.

Parties guided by explorers gain significant advantages on wilderness adventures. Any time the explorer's party is in country familiar to the explorer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the explorer's party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters.

A party guided by an explorer can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+. See the [Wilderness Adventures](Chapter06.md#wilderness-adventures) and [Evasion and Pursuit](Chapter06.md#evasion-and-pursuit) sections of Chapter 6 for more details on getting lost and evading encounters.

When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassures those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer's Charisma or proficiencies.

When an explorer reaches 9th level (Warden), he may decide to build a border fort in the borderlands or wilderness. When he does so, up to 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 explorers of 1st - 3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. The character becomes the warden of any nearby settlers, and will attract more settlers over time. These people will look to the Warden as their leader, responsible for the growth and safety of their settlement. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

## Demi-Human Classes


### Dwarven Vaultguard

| Prime Requisite: | STR
| :--------------- | :----
| Requirements:    | CON 9
| Hit Dice:        | 1d8
| Maximum Level:   | 13

Dwarves are stout, short, bearded demi-humans who average a height of approximately 4' and weigh about 150lb. Perhaps not surprisingly, they have skin, hair and eye colors in earth tones. Dwarves have a reputation for having surly attitudes, and are particularly gruff with elves. They value precious metals and stones, and live in deep underground vaults, where they endure constant raids from the orcs, trolls, and even worse denizens of the darkness below.

Dwarves trained to defend their race's underground vault from the endless hordes that threaten it are called vaultguards. Though most vaultguards are born, live and die in the vault, from time to time a young vaultguard will be dispatched to foreign realms on a warrior's pilgrimage. The few vaultguards who return from such pilgrimages bring gold and glory to their clans, often leading them to found new vaults and become great lords. The dwarven vaultguard class represents such a dwarf.

Dwarven vaultguards are highly trained combatants. At first level, dwarven vaultguards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Due to their short height, dwarven vaultguards cannot use human-sized two-handed weapons (such as two-handed swords or pole arms) or longbows, but they can use any other weapon or armor. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function.

In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the [Dwarven Vaultguard Attack and Saving Throws](Chapter02.md#dwarven-vaultguard-fighter-attack-and-saving-throws) table below. Dwarf characters will speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, dwarves can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

When a dwarven vaultguard reaches 9th level (Vaultlord), he can attract dwarves from far and wide by constructing his own underground vault. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character's clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A dwarven vaultguard is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Dwarven Craftpriest

| Prime Requisite: | WIS
| :--------------- | :----
| Requirements:    | CON 9
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 10

Nothing is so revered among the dwarven people as craftsmanship. A dwarf's work is his life, and the spirits of great dwarven artisans are believed to live on forever in their masterpieces. The veneration of these relics falls to the care of a caste of dwarves known as craftpriests. While most craftpriests attend to the shrines and monuments of their clan, young craftpriests are sometimes sent forth to recover monuments to the glorious past from the ancient ruins and wastelands of the world. This class represents such a craftpriest.

At first level, dwarven craftpriests hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Dwarven craftpriests advance in attack throws and saving throws as clerics, by two points every four levels of experience. Dwarven craftpriests may wear any armor and may use any of the traditional weapons of their people, including the battle axe, great axe, hand axe, flail, mace, morning star, and warhammer. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield or wielding a weapon two-handed, but may not dual wield weapons.

A dwarven craftpriest may turn undead like a cleric. Starting at 2nd level (Craft-Acolyte), a craftpriest may cast divine spells. Craftpriests follow the same spell progression as clerics, use the same rules for learning and casting spells, and select their spells from the same spell list. See the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for details. Because of their religious training, a craftpriest can automatically identify religious symbols, trappings, and holy days of the dwarven faith, and recognizes those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20.

In addition, each dwarven craftpriest is a journeyman in a particular type of craft, such as armor-making, leatherworking, weapon-smithing, etc. With access to craftsman's tools, the character can produce 20gp worth of items per month, and supervise 3 apprentices in his craft. When examining works of his craft, the craftpriest can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. Their attention to detail gives craftpriests a +3 bonus on proficiency rolls for other proficiencies they learn as well.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function. In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the [Dwarven Craftpriest Attack and Saving Throws](Chapter02.md#dwarven-craftpriest-cleric-attack-and-saving-throws) table below. Dwarven characters speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

Starting at 5th level (Craft-Vicar), a craftpriest may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Craft-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs, and craft magical constructs such as golems. At 9th level, he also can construct a vault that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves of the character's clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A Craft-Lord is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

## Alignment

In the Adventurer Conqueror King System, your character will enter a world of ceaseless violent struggle, where civilization is ever-assailed by forces intent on its destruction. In this perilous realm, he will be called to choose a side: Will he pledge to defend civilization and its allies against those who seek to destroy it? Will he sell his sword to any who can offer fame or fortune? Or will he become an agent of entropy and destruction undermining peace and order? This choice is called Alignment, and the three choices are Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.

**Law**: Lawful beings believe that civilization is worth fighting for. Despite its vices and villainies, civilization must be defended against those who would destroy it. Lawful beings tend to see wars among civilizations as aiding the cause of Chaos, and so they seek peace among Lawful civilizations where possible. However, Lawful characters are not pacifists, nor are they necessarily altruists. Indeed, most would think something was wrong with a hero who turned down fame and fortune; chests of gold, magnificent weapons, comely consorts, and grants of land are, after all, the rightful rewards for great deeds of valor on behalf of Law.

**Neutrality**: Neutral beings generally enjoy the benefits of law and civilization, but it is not something they directly fight for. They tend to focus on their own ends, whether those are family, fame, fortune, pleasure, or power. A Neutral mercenary might be found fighting on behalf of Law or Chaos; a neutral farmer tends his crops and pays his taxes, whether to the Patriarch or the Lich-King.

**Chaos**: Chaotic beings actively seek to destroy civil society. Chaotic characters are often madmen or cultists of forgotten, chthonic gods. To the extent they have any order at all, societies of Chaotic characters are ruled by force and fear, and are often characterized by all manner of corruption and vice. Even decadent Lawful civilizations at least pay homage to civilizing virtue, but chaotic civilizations embrace their corruption.

Note that a character's choice of Alignment doesn't determine whether or not he takes care of his children, cheats on his wife, or steals from the merchant's guild. It is concerned only with the weighty issue of where his allegiance lies in the grand struggles of existence. To have an alignment of Lawful or Chaotic is to have chosen a side in this perpetual struggle. Many people, choosing no side, are Neutral, although it is important to remember that most Neutrals still want the protection of Law even though they are not willing to die for it. (To paraphrase George Orwell, Neutral humans sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because Lawful heroes stand ready to do violence on their behalf.)

Human vices, such as greed, lust, and vanity, are widespread and common even in Lawful societies. But Chaotic societies are characterized by their monstrous vices: Genocide, human sacrifice, wanton destruction, cannibalism, necrophilia, and so on. Evil is all-too-human in every civilization, but Chaotic is something both less and more than human.

## Adventuring Parties

The worlds of Adventurer Conqueror King are dangerous and hostile. For the sake of survival, characters team up to undertake adventures because any number or type of monsters could lie in wait. Such groups, known as adventuring parties, are generally composed of a diverse array of classes, so that different characters are able to contribute their specific talents for any given situation. A thief can check for traps, for instance, and fighters are good for muscle. Clerics have spells for healing and divination, while mages are capable of powerful offensive and defensive magic.

Occasionally, there are not enough party members to take on the challenges of an adventure. The party may hire NPCs, such as henchmen or mercenaries, for extra hands. The rules for hiring henchmen and mercenaries are discussed in [Chapter 3, Equipment](Chapter03.md#chapter-3-equipment).

When there are only a small number of players, the Judge may allow them to each play more than one character. Nevertheless, in these cases characters belonging to the same player cannot offer each other special treatment, such as trading or giving away riches or magical items, unless the Judge rules it acceptable.
